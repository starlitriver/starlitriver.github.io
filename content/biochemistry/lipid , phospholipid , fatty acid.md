## lipid

Lipids are a broad group of molecules that are made from fatty acids.

Lipids include fats, waxes, steroids and others.

## phospholipid

Phospholipid is a class of lipid that has a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails.

Phospholipids are famous for constructing the [[cell membrane]] in the arrangement of a phospholipid bilayer.

## fatty acid

A fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with an aliphatic chain which is either saturated or unsaturated.

A fatty acid consists of a straight chain of an even number of carbon atoms, with a carboxyl group COOH at one end and a methyl group CH3 at another.

Saturated fatty acids have no double carbon double bonds. In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids have at least one.
