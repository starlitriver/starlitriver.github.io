## phospholipid

## phospholipid bilayer

A phospholipid bilayer is a structure that forms permeable or semi-permeable membranes.

A phospholipid bilayer is made of two layers of phospholipids, forming two sheets where the hydrophilic heads form the outside of the membrane and the hydrophobic tails form the middle of the membrane

Therefore, phospholipids are the smallest way to separate hydrated environments.

## plasma membrane

A plasma membrane is a network of lipids and proteins.

### composition

The plasma membrane consists of primarily lipids and proteins. It's based upon a [[phospholipid , vesicle , bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] membrane, and has additional components.


Plasma membranes are selectively permeable. They allow lipid-soluble molecules and some small molecules to permeate the membrane. They repel large, water-soluble molecules and electrically charged ions.

The model for the structure of the plasma membrane is called the fluid mosaic model, showing a mosaic of components that move freely and fluidly in the plane of the membrane, like marshmallows in your hot chocolate.



Proteins are integrated because they can transport things. Proteins that extend across the membrane are protein channels (also transmembrane proteins).
