protein structure is the 3D arrangement of atoms in proteins

protein structures range in size from tens to thousands of amino acids

protein structure levels help us determine the overall structure of a protein, with the  of primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure levels

## primary structure

primary structure is the most basic level  and it describes the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein

## secondary structure

secondary structure is the very basic folds the polymer makes through hydrogen bonding between amino acids
there are two different structures that can be formed depending on their shape: [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] and [[beta sheet|beta sheets]]

## tertiary structure

tertiary structure is when the protein starts to fold up in all sorts of weird and wacky ways due to ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, or hydrophobic reactions between R groups on the amino acids

## quaternary structure

quaternary structure occurs when multiple proteins comes together to make a larger protein
