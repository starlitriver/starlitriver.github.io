Mendelian inheritance is a type of biological inheritance, which was proposed by Gregor Mendel.

These principles form the foundation of classical genetics

A visual representation of Mendelian inheritance is the [[Punnett square]].

## the principle of segregation

each pair of alleles separates during gamete formation, resulting in each gamete receiving only one allele
this ensures that each trait is determined by two alleles, one from each parent

## the principle of dominance

one allele can be dominant over another, meaning that the dominant allele will be expressed in the phenotype even if the other allele is present
the recessive allele will only be expressed if both alleles are recessive

## the principle of independent assortment

alleles for different traits are sorted independently during gamete formation, resulting in a random combination of the alleles in the offspring
this means that the inheritance of one trait does not influence the inheritance of another trait
