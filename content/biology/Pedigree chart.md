A Pedigree chart is a diagram that shows the historical appearance of phenotypes.

- structured like a family tree
- each row is a generation and labelled with roman numerals on the left
- males are squares
- females are circles
- shaded shape means the individual demonstrates the trait
- not shaded shape means the individual does not demonstrate the trait
- half shaded shape means the individual is a heterozygous carrier of the trait
