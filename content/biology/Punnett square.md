A Punnett square is a visual representation of Mendelian inheritance used to determine the probability of genotypes in a particular cross.

Unlike [[Pedigree chart|Pedigree charts]] which shows observable phenotypes, Punnett squares show the genotype probabilities.

|     | A   | a   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A   | AA  | Aa  |
| a   | Aa  | aa  |

For example, in the Punnet square above, there is a quarter chance to get AA, a half change to get Aa, and a quarter chance to get aa.
