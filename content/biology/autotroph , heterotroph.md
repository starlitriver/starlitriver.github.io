An autotroph is an organism that make their own food.

Some plant and other cells may use photosynthesis to produce glucose as their sole source of energy.

Some prokaryotes can take chemicals to synthesize their own energy out of volcanic vents or something.


A heterotroph is an organism that needs to consume energy, meaning they need to do digestion.
