Taxonomy is the classification of things.

It can refer to the development of a system of classes (called a taxonomy), or to use the system to allocate items into the classes.

Biological taxonomy is the classification of life.

1. Domain
	There are 3 domains; bacteria, archaea and eukarya.
2. Kingdom
	There are 6 kingdoms; archaea, bacteria, protista, fungi, plantae and animalia.
3. Phylum
	There are about 100 to 150 recognized phyla. Examples include anthophyta (flowering plants) and chordata (animals with a notochord).
4. Class
	There are around 250 to 300 recognized classes. Examples include mammalia (mammals), aves (birds), and insecta (insects).
5. Order
6. Family
7. Genus
8. Species
	A species is the set group of organisms in which any two appropriate individuals can produce fertile offspring.

## domain

There are 3 domains; bacteria, archaea and eukarya.

Bacteria and archaea are unicellular life, from one single prokaryotic cell.

Eukarya are unicellular or multicellular life, from one or more eukaryotic cells.

## kingdom

Kingdoms are a classification group below [[biological taxonomy , domain , kingdom]] and above phylum.

There are 6 kingdoms; archaea, bacteria, protista, fungi, plantae and animalia.
