the Golgi apparatus, also called the Golgi body, was one of the first organelles to be discovered

in structure, the Golgi apparatus is made up of a series of compartments and is a collection of used, flattened membrane-enclosed disks known as cisternae, originating from clusters that bud off the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]

they sort proteins for transport to other organelles or outside of the cell

fun fact, it seems to be the only organelle that was named after a person: Camillo Golgi
