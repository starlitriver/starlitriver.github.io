the cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells

it is essential to maintain a suitable number of cells
[[cell division]] refers to the process in which 

## eukaryotic cell cycle

[[mitosis]] produces two identical daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell (diploid)
[[meiosis]] produces two different daughter cells gametes, for sexual reproduction (haploid)

## prokaryotic cell cycle

all prokaryotic cells replicate using binary fission

here are 2 types of prokaryotic cells, bacteria and archaea.

prokaryotic cells do not contain a nucleus or membrane bound organelles

the cell wall of most bacteria is made of peptidoglycan

they have one circular chromosome of DNA which floats in the cytoplasm, called the nucleoid, as well as small circular pieces of DNA called plasmids
