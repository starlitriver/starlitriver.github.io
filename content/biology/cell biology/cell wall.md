in cell biology, a cell wall is an [[organelle]] found immediately inside the [[cell membrane]] primarily providing the cell with structural support

the cell wall also helps the cell withstand [[osmotic pressure]]
a cell wall can be tough, flexible or rigid

### composition

the composition of cell walls varies across taxonomy
in land plants, the primary cell wall comprises of [[carbohydrate , monosaccharide , polysaccharide|polysaccharides]] like cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin
other polymers such as lignin, suberin or cutin are often anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls

algae have cell walls composed of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as carrageenan and agar

wood and bark cells of trees have secondary cell walls, a thicker additional layer of cellulose used to increase cell wall rigidity
