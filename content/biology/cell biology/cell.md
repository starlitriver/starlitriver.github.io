in biology, a cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an [[organism]]
cells are between organelles and tissues in [[biological organization]]

[[organelle|organelles]] are specialized cellular parts that has specific functions analogous to organs

everything inside a cell except the [[nucleus]] is called the [[cytoplasm]], enclosed within the [[cell membrane]] and held together by the [[cytoskeleton]]

the two main types of cells are [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]]
to sort by taxonomy, we have [[plant cell|plant cells]] and [[animal cell|animal cells]]

the surface area of a cell determines how many molecules can move in and out of the cell
therefore, cells need to optimize their [[surface area to volume ratio]] - bigger cells need more energy and produce more waste, so cells that are too large cannot survive
so, cells with organelles are always larger than cells without because the ones without are not large enough to need organelles
