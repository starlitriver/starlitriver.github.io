in cell biology, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an [[organelle]] made up of two subunits, the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] and the [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]]

rough ER for translation and folding of new proteins, smooth ER for expression of lipids

the ER is part of the [[endomembrane system]] in eukaryotic cells
it has important functions like [[protein folding]]
