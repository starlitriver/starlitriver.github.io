in cell biology, meiosis is a special type of [[cell division]] in sexually reproducing organisms that produces gametes

it involves two rounds of division that ultimately result in 4 haploid cells

stages of meiosis are
- prophase I
- metaphase I
- anaphase I
- telophase I
- prophase II
- metaphase II
- anaphase II
- telophase II

meiosis I refers to phases prophase I through telophase I
meiosis II refers to phases prophase II to telophase II

## prophase I

prophase I is the longest phase of meiosis
it lasts 13 out of 14 days of meiosis in mice

chromosomes condense and the [[spindle apparatus]] begins to use centrioles to form spindles
synapsis occurs between pairs of homologous chromosomes
crossing over and recombination occur between these pairs of synapsed homologous chromosomes
the nuclear membrane breaks down

## metaphase I

pairs of homologous chromosomes line up along the equatorial plate at the center of the cell
this occurs randomly through independent assortment
spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes

## anaphase I

disjunction of homologous chromosomes occurs when the spindle contracts, so one member of each homologous pair moves opposite poles of the cell

## telophase I

chromosome become less condensed
two new nuclear membranes form

## prophase II

in both of the two daughter cells,
chromosomes condense
nuclear membrane breaks down
spindle fibers form from the centrioles

## metaphase II

in both of the two daughter cells,
pairs of homologous chromosomes line up along the equatorial plate at the center of the cell
this occurs randomly through independent assortment
spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes

## anaphase II

in both of the two daughter cells,
sister chromatids separate

## telophase II

chromosomes become less condensed and the 4 cells each form a new nuclear membrane
resulting in 4 gametes
