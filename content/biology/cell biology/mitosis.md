mitosis is part of the [[cell cycle]], and aims to produce two identical daughter cells from one cell

mitosis is preceded by interphase, during which the cells goes DNA replication

stages of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis

## prophase

condensation of chromosomes

during prophase, the [[DNA replication|DNA that was replicated]] during interphase is condensed from strands with lengths reaching 0.7 Î¼m down to 0.2-0.3 Î¼m
this way, the loose and string like DNA become clumped together

movement of centrosomes

Replicated [[centrosome|centrosomes]] from interphase move apart towards opposite poles of the cell, powered by centrosome associated motor proteins
interdigitated [[microtubule|microtubules]] from each [[centrosome]] interact with each other, helping to move the [centrosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome "Centrosome") to opposite poles

chromatin begins to condense and centrioles move to the opposite sides of the cell, creating spindle fibers between them
as sister chromatids become visible, the nucleus disappears in prophase

## metaphase

the chromosomes start to line up at the equator of the cell and attach themselves to a spindle fiber

spindle fibers from the [[spindle apparatus]] attach to the chromosomes and line them up along the middle of the cell

## anaphase

in cell biology, anaphase is the third stage of [[mitosis]] when replicated chromosomes are split and the newly-copied chromosomes, [[sister chromatids]], are moved to opposite poles of the cell

one chromatid from each chromosome is dragged in opposite directions of the cell by the [[centriole]]

spindle fibers shorten and pull each of the sister chromatids to either side of the cell by the kinetochore latching onto the spindle fibers

## telophase

the chromosomes start to de-condense and become thinner
new nuclear membranes starts to form around the chromosomes

## cytokinesis

in [[cytokinesis]] the cell divides into two daughter cells, completing division
