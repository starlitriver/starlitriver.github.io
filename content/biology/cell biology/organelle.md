An organelle is a specialized [[cell|cellular]] part that has a specific function.

The major eukaryotic organelles include the nucleus, cell membrane, cell wall, chloroplast, ER, Golgi apparatus, mitochondrion, and vacuole.

## cell membrane

The [[cell membrane]] separates the cell interior from the outside environment.

All cells have them.

## cell wall

The cell wall is a rigid structure composed of cellulose, to provide structure.

Plants and protists can have them.

## chloroplast
