A prokaryotic cell is a microscopic single-celled organism.

Since it has one cell, a prokaryote (organism) is the exact same thing as a prokaryotic cell (cell).

Prokaryotic cells have one circular chromosome of DNA which floats in the cytoplasm, called the nucleoid, as well as small circular pieces of DNA called plasmids
