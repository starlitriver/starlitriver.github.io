in cell biology, protein synthesis is a core biological process balancing the loss of cellular proteins though the production of new proteins

protein synthesis involves reading information from DNA to know the sequence of [[amino acid|amino acids]] needed to construct a protein, and then constructing the protein

protein synthesis can be divided into two phases: transcription and translation

### transcription

transcription is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA

during transcription, a section of DNA encoding a protein, called a gene, is converted into a mRNA

transcription begins when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to the DNA at a specific region call the promoter
the DNA double helix is unwound and the RNA polymerase moves along, reading the amino acid sequence and adds corresponding nucleotides to a new mRNA chain
when the RNA polymerase reaches the end of the gene, it releases the mRNA

### translation

the generated proteins is a sequence of amino acids, coded by the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA

in translation, mRNA is transported out of the nucleus and decoded in a [[ribosome]]
ribosomes have binding sites
at the binding sites, each triplet of nucleotides on the mRNA (called a codon) attract a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule loaded with a matching triplet of nucleotides (called an anticodon) that is attached to a corresponding amino acid (following the RNA codon table)
