in cell biology, ribosomes are macromolecular machines used for the translation phase of [[protein synthesis]]

ribosomes consists of a complex of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins

ribosomes exist as two separate subunits until they are attracted to a binding site on the mRNA molecule when they join together, starting the process of [[protein synthesis]]
