in biology, stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can change into various [[cell type|cell types]]



stem cells can undergo [[cellular differentiation]] and use [[cell proliferation]] to produce more of the same stem cell
self renewal means a stem cell can produce both a differentiated cell and a copy of itself

potency measures the stem cell's capacity to differentiate into different cell types
- totipotent - can differentiate into any type
- pluripotent - can differentiate into multiple cell types
- multipotent - can differentiate into a limited number of specialized cell types belonging to a specific tissue or organ
- unipotent - can only produce only one cell type but have the property of self-renewal that distinguishes them from non-stem cells
