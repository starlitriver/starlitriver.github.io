A stem cell is a cell yet to be specialized.



Stem cells can undergo [[cellular differentiation]] and use [[cell proliferation]] to produce more stem cells.

Self renewal means a stem cell can produce both a differentiated cell and a copy of itself.


Potency measures the stem cell's capacity to differentiate into different cell types
- totipotent - can differentiate into any type
- pluripotent - can differentiate into multiple cell types
- multipotent - can differentiate into a limited number of specialized cell types belonging to a specific tissue or organ
- unipotent - can only produce only one cell type but have the property of self-renewal that distinguishes them from non-stem cells
