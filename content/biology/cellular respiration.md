Cellular respiration is the set of [[metabolism|metabolic]] reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy into ATP.

Steps of cellular respiration:
- glycolysis
- preparatory reaction
- Krebs cycle
- electron transport chain

## glycolysis

Glycolysis, (also called anaerobic respiration) is the part of [[cellular respiration]] that doesn't require oxygen, converting glucose into pyruvate while releasing free energy used to form ATP and NADH.

Occurs in the cytoplasm.

Input:
- 2 ATP
- 1 glucose
Output:
- 4 ATP per glucose
- pyruvate

## Krebs cycle

The Krebs cycle (also the citric acid cycle) is a series of reactions in cellular respiration used to release the energy stored in nutrients.

Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.

Pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA, which enters the cycle.


Input:
- 2 acetyl CoA (converted from pyruvate)
- 6 NAD⁺
- 2 FAD

Output:
- 4 carbon dioxide
- 2 ATP
- 6 NADH
- 2 FADH₂

## electron transport chain

An electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of protein complexes and molecules that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions.

Occurs in the mitochondrion cristae (foldings in the middle).

Input:
- oxygen
- 10 NADH
- 2 FADH₂

Output:
- water
- 26 to 28 ATP
- NAD⁺
- FAD
