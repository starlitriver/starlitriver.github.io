The human digestive system is an [[organ system]] used for digestion.

It consists of the gastrointestinal tract and the accessory organs of digestion including the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder

## intro

- Mechanical chewing that breaks the food up into pieces.
- Saliva contains enzymes called amylase that chemically breaks down sugars 
The oesophagus is a tube connected to the stomach, pushing food down into the stomach.

- The stomach is filled with a strong acid that breaks the food down chemically, and the stomach muscles also churn the food.
- The pancreas releases enzymes and indirectly break down macromolecules in the small intestine.

- The gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine and breaks down fats
- The small intestine absorbs most of the food, with cells that have lots of surface area for absorption of the nutrients.
- The large intestine absorbs water left over from the small intestine.
