in genetics, dominance is the phenomenon of one allele of a gene on a chromosome overriding the effect of a different allele of the same gene on another copy of the chromosome

dominance is a common phenomenon in [[Mendelian inheritance]]

different kinds of dominance are 

- complete dominance (Mendelian) - only one allele is dominant and the other alleles are not seen
- co-dominance (non-Mendelian) - no allele is the most powerful, so both alleles are seen in the phenotype. for example, red and white make part red and part white.
- incomplete dominance (non-Mendelian) - Â no allele is the most powerful, so the alleles mix and produce a different phenotype altogether. for example, red and white make pink.
