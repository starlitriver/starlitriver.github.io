Genetic variation is variation in an organism's genetic material.

It can be caused by:
- mutation
- natural selection
- artificial selection
- gene flow, movement of genes between different groups of the species
- random mating
- random fertilization
- crossing over in meiosis recombination in sexual reproduction
