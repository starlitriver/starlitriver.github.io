there are basically two domains, prokaryotes and eukaryotes


[[kingdoms comparison]]

## domains

### prokaryotes

all prokaryotes are single celled organisms.


Bacteria and archaea are what we call prokaryotic cells


Bacteria are the epitome of what i means to survive

. on the other hand, eukaryotic cells are used to comprise more complex






the pro in prokaryotes actually mean, before. they are a lot more simplistic and a lot more smaller than eukaryotic cells.

the DNA is free floating in the prokaryotes.

### eukaryotes

we have protists, animal cells, plant, and fungi.
