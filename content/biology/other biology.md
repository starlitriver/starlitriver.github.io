Hyperthyroidism is when you have too much metabolism as a result of an overactive thyroid gland, which produces thyroxine. The most common cause is Graves' disease, and autoimmune disease. B lymphocytes mistakenly produce antibodies aginst the TSH receptors on thyroid cells. When these antibodies bind to TSH receptors, they stimulate production of thyroxine.
