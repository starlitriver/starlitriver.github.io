Photosynthesis is the process of generating glucose. Photosynthesis inputs water and carbon dioxide and outputs glucose, water, and oxygen.

Chemical equation of photosynthesis: $\mathrm{12H_2O+6CO_{2}\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6H_2O+6O_2}$

## light dependent reaction

The light dependent reaction uses light energy to split the water into oxygen and hydrogen.

Occurs in thylakoid membranes.


Sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, a pigment called chlorophyll
once light is absorbed water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, releasing electrons in the process
the hydrogen and electrons go through the electron transport chain in order to attach a phosphate onto ADP in order to create ATP.


Inputs:
- light
- water
- NADP+
- ADP

Outputs:
- NADPH
- ATP
- oxygen

A thylakoid is a disc thing in the chloroplast.  A stack of them is a granum.



NADP+ is a carrier molecule that can carry a hydrogen atom. It carries hydrogen to and from the thylakoids 

## light independent reaction

The light independent reaction (also the Calvin cycle) takes carbon dioxide and the previous products of NADPH and ATP to fix the carbon dioxide gas into G3P, for making glucose.

Occurs in the stroma.

Inputs:
- carbon dioxide
- NADPH
- ATP

Outputs:
- G3P (can be used to make glucose)
- NADP+
- ADP
