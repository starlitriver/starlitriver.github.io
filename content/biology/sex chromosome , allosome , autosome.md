Sex chromosomes (also allosomes) are chromosomes that determine the sex of an individual.

Humans have a genome that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair, for a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes

The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1â€“22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters.
