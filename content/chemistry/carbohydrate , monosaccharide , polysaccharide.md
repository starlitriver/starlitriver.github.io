Definition of carbohydrate: a molecule that consists of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms, usually with a C:H:O ratio of 1:2:1.

A carbohydrate that contains 2 monosaccharide units it's called a disaccharide; if 3 to 10 units it's called a oligosaccharide; if more than 10 it's called a polysaccharide.

## monosaccharide

Monosaccharides (also simple sugars) are the simplest units of carbohydrates.

They are colorless, water-soluble and crystalline shaped solids.

Monosaccharides include:
- glucose
- fructose
- galactose

## polysaccharide

A polysaccharide is a long-chain polymer composed of more than 10 monosaccharides.

Polysaccharides can have distinct properties from their monomers - they can be amorphous or insoluble in water.

Storage polysaccharides are common storage methods of energy. They can be broken down for converting into usable energy.
- starch
- glycogen
- galactogen
- inulin

Structural polysaccharides cannot be metabolized by most organisms. For example:
- cellulose
- chitin
- pectin
