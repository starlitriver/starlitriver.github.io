a catalyst is a substance that can be added to a reaction to increase the reaction rate without getting consumed in the process.

catalysts typically speed up a reaction by reducing the activation energy or changing the reaction mechanism.

enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions.

## how catalysts work

catalysts work by
- lowering the energy of the transition state, thus lowering the activation energy, and/or
- changing the mechanism of the reaction. This also changes the nature (and energy) of the transition state.

Catalysts are everywhere! Many biochemical processes, such as the oxidation of glucose, are heavily dependent on **enzymes**, proteins that behave as catalysts.

## types of catalysts

### enzymes
