in chemistry, osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to precent the inward flow of its pure solved across a semipermeable membrane
it is also defined as the measure of the tendency of a solution to take in its pure solvent by [[osmosis]]

osmosis occurs when two solutions containing different concentrations of solute are separated by a selectively permeable membrane. solvent molecules pass preferentially through the membrane from the low-concentration solution to the solution with higher solute concentration.
the transfer of solvent molecules will continue until equilibrium is attained
