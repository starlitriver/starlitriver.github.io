Polarity is a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule having an electric dipole moment (ends positively charged and negatively charged).


In a bond, polarity measures the electronegativity difference between two bonded atoms. The difference determines the bond name: ==<0.4 = non-polar covalent bond, 0.4-2.0 = polar covalent bond, >2.0 = ionic bond==.
