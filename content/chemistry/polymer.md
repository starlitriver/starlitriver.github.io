in chemistry, a polymer is a substance or material consisting of [[macromolecule|macromolecules]] linked together into chains of repeating subunits

polymers are made of monomeric units called [[monomer|monomers]] that are covalently bonded in chains to form larger molecules

even though polymers are made from [[macromolecule|macromolecules]], some larger macromolecules are made from polymers - the definition checks out

natural polymers found in biology are called [[biopolymers]]
