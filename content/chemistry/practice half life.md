### Detailed Content Description

#### Top Section: Questions 1–11

This section consists of 11 questions designed to reinforce understanding of nuclear physics concepts. Below is a detailed description of each question, including explanations and answers where applicable:

1. **Name the isotope that has an atomic number of 11 and contains 12 neutrons.**
	 - The atomic number (Z) is the number of protons, so Z = 11 means 11 protons. The number of neutrons is given as 12. The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + neutrons = 11 + 12 = 23. This isotope is Sodium-23, written as \( \ce{^{23}_{11}Na} \).

2. **How many protons and neutrons are there in one atom of each of the following isotopes?**
	 - **a. Hydrogen-2 (deuterium)**: Hydrogen has Z = 1 (1 proton). Mass number A = 2, so neutrons = A - Z = 2 - 1 = 1. **Answer**: 1 proton, 1 neutron.
	 - **b. Americium-241**: Americium has Z = 95 (95 protons). Mass number A = 241, so neutrons = 241 - 95 = 146. **Answer**: 95 protons, 146 neutrons.
	 - **c. Europium-164**: Europium has Z = 63 (63 protons). Mass number A = 164, so neutrons = 164 - 63 = 101. **Answer**: 63 protons, 101 neutrons.

3. **What force acts between a proton and a neutron and under what conditions does it act?**
	 - The strong nuclear force acts between nucleons (protons and neutrons). It operates only at very short distances, typically within the nucleus (about 10⁻¹⁵ meters), and is much stronger than the electromagnetic force at these ranges, binding the nucleus together.

4. **The half-life of caesium-134 is 2.06 years. What fraction of caesium is left after 10.3 years?**
	 - Calculate the number of half-lives: \( n = \frac{10.3}{2.06} = 5 \). After 5 half-lives, the fraction remaining is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32} \). **Answer**: 1/32 of the original amount remains.

5. **What is meant when an isotope is described to be stable?**
	 - A stable isotope does not undergo radioactive decay. Its nucleus has a balanced configuration of protons and neutrons, where the strong nuclear force effectively counteracts the electromagnetic repulsion between protons, preventing emission of radiation.

6. **If the strong nuclear force acts between all nucleons and is much stronger than the electromagnetic force at the distance of two neighboring nucleons in a nucleus, explain how a nucleus might be unstable.**
	 - Despite the strong nuclear force’s strength, a nucleus can become unstable if there are too many protons, increasing electromagnetic repulsion, or an imbalanced neutron-to-proton ratio. These conditions can overpower the strong force, leading to radioactive decay.

7. **100 grams of a radioactive isotope is delivered to a hospital. Three hours later there is only 6.25 grams left. What is the half-life of the isotope?**
	 - The decay sequence is: 100 g → 50 g → 25 g → 12.5 g → 6.25 g, which is 4 half-lives in 3 hours. Thus, each half-life is \( \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \) hours. **Answer**: 0.75 hours.

8. **Sketch a graph of the decay of the isotope in question 7.**
	 - The graph would be an exponential decay curve:
		 - At t = 0 hours: 100 g
		 - At t = 0.75 hours: 50 g
		 - At t = 1.5 hours: 25 g
		 - At t = 2.25 hours: 12.5 g
		 - At t = 3 hours: 6.25 g
	 - The y-axis represents mass (g), and the x-axis represents time (hours), showing a steep, downward curve leveling off as time increases.

9. **Why are half-lives used for radioactive isotopes rather than just stating how long they take to decay?**
	 - Radioactive decay is a random, exponential process where the amount of isotope never fully reaches zero. Half-life provides a consistent measure of decay rate—the time for half the atoms to decay—making it more practical than an indefinite total decay time.

10. **The activity (decays per second) of a radioactive isotope halves with each half-life. Explain why that would be the case.**
		- Activity is the rate of decay, proportional to the number of radioactive atoms. As the number of atoms halves with each half-life, the activity also halves, reflecting the reduced number of decaying nuclei.

11. **You need 20 grams of a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 3 hours. How much would you need to buy if it takes 24 hours to deliver it?**
		- Number of half-lives in 24 hours: \( n = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \). After 8 half-lives, you need 20 g, so the initial amount is \( 20 \times 2^8 = 20 \times 256 = 5120 \) grams. **Answer**: 5120 grams.

#### Bottom Section: 4.2 Exam Questions

This section contains five exam-style questions, including multiple-choice and short-answer formats, each with assigned marks:

**Question 1 (1 mark)**  
- **MC: What is the atomic number (Z) of an element?**  
	- A. The number of neutrons in the nucleus  
	- B. The number of protons in the nucleus  
	- C. The number of nucleons in the nucleus  
	- D. The total number of nucleons and electrons in the atom  
	- **Answer**: B. The number of protons in the nucleus (Z defines the element).

**Question 2 (1 mark)**  
- **MC: Which of the following best describes all the isotopes of an element?**  
	- A. Same number of protons; different number of neutrons  
	- B. Same number of neutrons; different number of protons  
	- C. Same number of nucleons; different number of protons  
	- D. Same number of nucleons; different number of neutrons  
	- **Answer**: A. Same number of protons; different number of neutrons (isotopes vary in neutron count).

**Question 3 (1 mark)**  
- **MC: A radioactive element has a half-life of 6.0 days. A sample of this material initially contains 12,400 nuclei. How many radioactive nuclei are remaining after 12 days?**  
	- A. 6200  
	- B. 3100  
	- C. 1550  
	- D. 775  
	- **Calculation**: 12 days = 2 half-lives (12 / 6 = 2). After 2 half-lives: \( 12,400 / 4 = 3100 \). **Answer**: B. 3100.

**Question 4 (3 marks)**  
- **A radioactive source has a half-life of 50 years. It currently contains 10,000 of the unstable nuclei. How many unstable nuclei were there in the source 200 years ago? Show your reasoning.**  
	- **Reasoning**: 200 years ago = 4 half-lives (200 / 50 = 4). Going backward, multiply by 2 per half-life: \( 10,000 \times 2^4 = 10,000 \times 16 = 160,000 \).  
	- **Answer**: 160,000 unstable nuclei.

**Question 5 (3 marks)**  
- **The initial activity of a radioactive source is 8000 decays per second. After 1 day it has decreased to 1000 decays per second. What is the half-life of this source (in hours)? Show your reasoning.**  
	- **Reasoning**: Decay from 8000 to 1000 is 3 half-lives (8000 → 4000 → 2000 → 1000). 1 day = 24 hours, so each half-life = \( 24 / 3 = 8 \) hours.  
	- **Answer**: 8 hours.
