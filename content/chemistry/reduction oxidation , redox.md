## oxidation number

The oxidation of free elements is zero.

The oxidation of simple ions is equal to their charge.

Some elements have fixed oxidation numbers

- Main group metals have oxidation number equal to their valency
- H is oxidation of +1 when it forms with non-metals and -1 in metal hydrides like NaH and $\mathrm{CaH_2}$
- In a molecule that is not pure oxygen, oxygen has oxidation of -2, except in $\mathrm{F_2O}$ is +2 and in some other is -1.
- Flouride is -1
- Sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral molecule is zero.
- Sum of oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion is the charge on the ion.

## very complex

Balancing complex half equations

Mn2+ +BiO_3- to Bi3+ + MnO_4-

## Balance unique atoms (anything not oxygens and hydrogens)

4H_2O + Mn2+ to MnO_4- +8H+

## Balance oxygens using water

4H_2O + Mn2+ to MnO_4-

## Balance hydrogens using protons

add random hydrogens

4H_2O + Mn2+ to MnO_4- +8H+

## Balance charges using electrons

add random electrons

4H_2O + Mn2+ to MnO_4- +8H+ + 5e-

## Balance unique atoms (anything not oxygens and hydrogens)

BiO_3- to Bi^3+

## Balance oxygens using water

BiO_3- to Bi^3+ + 3H_2O

## Balance hydrogens using protons

add random hydrogens

6H+ + BiO_3- to Bi^3+ + 3H_2O

## Balance charges using electrons

add random electrons

2e- + 6H+ + BiO_3- to Bi^3+ + 3H_2O
