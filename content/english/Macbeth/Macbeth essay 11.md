How does Macbeth explore the theme of fate vs free will?


- Shakespeare examines the tension between the characters' choices and the prophesised outcomes told by the witches.
- Macbeth explores the effect of the supernatural on one's free will, using prophecies.
- Distinction between the prophecies and Macbeth's own decisions driven by ambition and desire, which he admitted.
