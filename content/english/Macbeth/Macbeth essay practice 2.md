Through Macbeth, Shakespeare suggests that the world will crumble if the natural order is not maintained. Do you agree?

prompt breakdown:
world - the state of things back in old England or something
crumble - chaos and death
natural order - how things were meant to be decided by God
maintain - many things disrupts instead of maintains, like the witches

ideas:
the things that the witches did were very disruptive
Macbeth was made to kill the king, effectively breaking nature in a significant way




contention: Macbeth is not a morally bad person

arguments:
- the things he do are caused by the supernatural things
- he was a nice person originally and would be if he had not been controlled


template:
say contention a little bit
say stuff
prove stuff
explain proof
summary of the argument



Macbeth is a play about the eponymous main character Macbeth as he does bad things and rises to power. He kills people and ultimately loses his life in the tragic ending.
