AMBITION
Macbeth Quotes: Ambition | SparkNotes

Ambition is the driving force of many events in Macbeth. Ambition is what fuels Macbeth's rise to power and eventual corruption. On the surface, Shakespeare seems to paint ambition as a bad thing, and by Macbeth's ambitious
nature, he associates it with chaos and evil. Lady Macbeth is also corrupted by ambition.

However, it is hinted that ambition is not what turns Macbeth evil, instead the evil was already inside of him from the start. This is because Banquo, who like Macbeth, has ambition, and also like Macbeth, was lured by the
witches' prophecies at the start, but never gave into evil.

QUOTES

“I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself
And falls on th’other” (1.7)

Macbeth is doubting his plan to murder King Duncan. He says that he has ambition but is unable to motivate himself to kill Duncan, comparing himself to a rider who cannot use their spurs to motivate their horse to run faster.
But, the ambition is still inside of him, however he believes that he will be unsuccessful in achieving his goal, which is compared to a horse who tries to leap over an obstacle, but falls short.

“Two truths are told
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of th’imperial theme” (1.3)

After Macbeth’s meeting with the three witches, he realises that 2 out of the three prophecies had been fulfilled, in which Macbeth wondered if their third prediction would also come true. As a result, ambition is found within
Macbeth for the first time in the play, which guides him towards murdering Duncan.

"For mine own good
All causes shall give way. I am in blood
Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er." (3.4)

After Macbeth’s frightening interactions with the ghost of Banquo, this quote reveals how he has been controlled by his ambitions, and has to continue down a violent path in order to keep the throne. By referring to himself as
“in blood,” he admits that he has been trapped inside of his own actions, and has no way of escaping apart from continuing his bloodthirsty actions. The final line shows us that it is too late for Macbeth to return to his
normal self.


“But ‘tis strange: And often sometimes, to win us to our harm, The instruments of darkness tell us truths,” Act 1 Scene 3

“It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul’s flight, If it find heaven, must it find out tonight.”


GUILT

“Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas incarnadine” (2.2)

After Macbeth returns from murdering Duncan, he refers to the blood on his hands as a sense of guilt, which will never be lost inside of him. He also mentions how the large amount of blood would be enough to turn all the
oceans red, which shows us the sheer amount of guilt he immediately suffers. Lady Macbeth tries to reassure him by saying how the blood can simply be washed off, however, the memories of the murder will scar him for life.

"For mine own good
All causes shall give way. I am in blood
Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er." (3.4)

After Macbeth’s frightening interactions with the ghost of Banquo, this quote reveals how he has been controlled by his ambitions, and has to continue down a violent path in order to keep the throne. By referring to himself as
“in blood,” he admits that he has been trapped inside of his own actions, and has no way of escaping apart from continuing his bloodthirsty actions. The final line shows us that it is too late for Macbeth to return to his
normal self.

"Art not without ambition, but without the illness should attend it,"  Act 5 Scene 1

“More she needs the divine than the physician” Act 5 Scene 1

“Here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand” Act 5 Scene 1

“To know my deed, ‘twere best not know myself” Act 2 Scene 2

FATE/DESTINY
If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, Without my stir. - Macbeth (1.3)

This quote demonstrates how Macbeth contemplates the prophecy of the witches who have told him that he will become king. Macbeth expresses how if fate suggests him to become king, it will happen with no effort on his behalf.
By referring to his future position as being provided “Without [his] stir” it is clear that he would like fate to make him king without having to do anything.

Macbeth shall never be vanquished until, Great Birnam Wood to high dunsinane hill, shall come against him. - 3 witches (4.1)

Context:
This prophecy by the witches is important as it predicts Macbeth’s eventual downfall. The prophecy states that Macbeth will remain king until the impossible happens. This is because the trees of “Great Birnam Wood” march
against him at Dunsinane Hill - The location of his castle.  Macbeth takes this prophecy literally and anticipates that he is safe from any threat to his reign. However, this prophecy becomes true when Malcolm and his soldiers
cut down branches from Birnam Wood and carry them as camouflage to Dunsinane hill. This creates the illusion of a moving forest, fulfilling the prophecy leading to Macbeth’s defeat.



MASCULINITY

“What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.”
Act 1 Scene 2

“I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none.”

Act 1 Scene 4

“Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower, But be the serpent under’t. He that’s coming.” Act 1 Scene 5

“I see thee still; And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before…
Now o’er the one half- world, Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse. The curtain’d sleep; witchcraft celebrates. Pale Hecate’s offerings; and wither’d
murder.” Act 2 Scene 1

“Know that it was he in the times past which held you. So under fortune, which you thought had been” Act 3 Scene 1

Macbeth Practice Essay
'Partners in ambition, partners in blood.'
How accurately does this describe the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth? Discuss.
William Shakespeare’s tragic play, Macbeth, set in the Jacobean era of Scotland, highlights the destruction of usurping the natural order, and consequences of
these actions. In his play, the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth is vital in the development of the plot, as both characters are pivotal in the
murder of King Duncan. Their bond can be described as “partners in ambition, [and] partners in blood,” as they work together to see Macbeth rise to king. Whilst
both characters hold ambition inside of them, they also share the guilt of their actions, which leads to both of their downfalls. However, whilst Lady Macbeth
will do whatever it takes to see her husband become king, Macbeth possesses awareness of the possible consequences that could fall as a result of Duncan’s
murder. As a whole, Shakespeare’s play explores the importance and side-effects of many relationships throughout the text.

Both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth’s personalities are very similar in Shakespeare’s play, as they both share ambition towards murdering Duncan. After Macbeth hears
about the witch’s prophecies that aim to announce him as “king hereafter,” he instantly becomes intrigued in fulfilling their predictions for him to become the
king. This fuels Macbeth with the urge to murder Duncan, illustrating his staggering ambition to be Scotland’s king. In comparison to Lady Macbeth, it is also
evident that she shares similar ambitions to Macbeth, as she encourages him to commit the murder. Lady Macbeth’s ambition leads to her providing many pieces of
advice to Macbeth which would help him not get caught, and easily end up on the throne. By suggesting that he should “look like [an] innocent flower, but be [a]
serpent [underneath],” Lady Macbeth’s ambitions further fuel Macbeth’s determination to become king. With both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth sharing their strong
ambitions for Macbeth to become king, they can be referred to as “partners in ambition,” which overall describes their relationship throughout the play.

On top of their ambitions, the similarities in guilt shared between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are vital in their relationship. Throughout the beginning of the
play, Shakespeare suggests that Lady Macbeth overpowered Macbeth in their relationship, with her influences reflecting on the downfall of Macbeth. As soon as
Macbeth returned from Duncan’s dead body, he immediately felt the sense of guilt of killing such an important figure. He mentions how not even “Great Neptune's
ocean” could wash the blood off of his hands, which refers to the guilt and shame left inside of him after committing the unholy act. After his next murder,
Macbeth is shown to have hallucinations during his royal banquet, seeing a figure of the ghost of Banquo, who was murdered earlier on in the day by his
assassins. Lady Macbeth would once again tell him off for these actions, not understanding the guilt that was engulfed inside of Macbeth. However, later on in
the play, Lady Macbeth’s unravelling finally began, as she began to feel the guilt that had early resonated inside of Macbeth. When doctors were managing her
unusual actions, Lady Macbeth spoke about how not even “all perfumes of Arabia,” could hide the blood on her hands, once again demonstrating the guilt that never
leaves after being involved in a shocking murder. Even though it had taken a while for Lady Macbeth to feel the guilt of murdering Duncan, by the end of the
play, both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth’s relationship could be described as “partners in blood,” sharing the same sorrows for Duncan’s death.

Although Shakespeare’s play aims to portray both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth as very similar characters, Lady Macbeth lacks the sense of awareness which is found
within Macbeth. After his initial excitement of his plan to murder Duncan and become king, Macbeth understands that this task isn’t as easy as it seemed to be.
With Lady Macbeth constantly influencing his opinions on the murder, Macbeth tries his hardest to stick to his own gut, and resist the murder due to his lack of
motivation. This feeling is referred to as a jockey on a horse, as Macbeth “[has] no spurs, [...] but only vaulting ambition,” which shows us that he only has
the ambitions to become king, but not enough motivation to partake in an inhumane act. Macbeth also understands that he will feel an instant sense of regret by
killing Duncan, mentioning how “blood will have blood,” showing how Duncan’s blood will consist of guilt inside of him. But, Lady Macbeth’s influences overpower
Macbeth, as Macbeth inevitably ends up stabbing duncan. Whilst most of the play shows the similarities between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, it is clear that
Macbeth’s awareness understands the consequences that would follow after murdering Duncan, which Lady Macbeth does not contain.

Overall, Shakespeare’s play, Macbeth, follows the strong relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Throughout the story, these characters can be described
as being “partners in ambition, [and] partners in blood,” which is reflected by their similarities in holding ambition and guilt. However, it is shown that
Macbeth has a sense of awareness relating to the consequences involved with a murder as large as the king, which Lady Macbeth did not possess. Ultimately,
Shakespeare’s play is crucial in depicting the influences of relationships on people throughout the world, and the many effects that they could have on a
person’s thoughts, actions and personality.
