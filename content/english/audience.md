## knowledge

You adjust your language based on what you believe your audience already knows. You'd explain a complex concept differently to a child than to an expert.

## relationship

Your relationship with the audience (friend, family, boss, stranger) dictates the level of formality, the type of vocabulary, and the tone you use.

## status and power

If there's a power imbalance (e.g., teacher-student, employer-employee), the person with less power will typically use more formal and deferential language.

## how many

Speaking to a large group often requires more formal language and a more structured delivery than speaking to a single person.

## expectations

The audience's expectations about the communication, maybe a formal presentation, maybe a casual chat.

## other things

Demographic factors like age, gender and others.
