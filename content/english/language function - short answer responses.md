These sample responses are based on actual student responses, some may have been edited slightly. While these are likely to score highly, they are not necessarily “perfect” responses.

## Identify one function in the text with a line number that demonstrates this function. /1

One function is the text is referential, as seen in line 5-6.

When the question asks for function, make sure to pick one of Jakobson’s six functions: referential, emotive, phatic, conative, poetic, metalinguistic.

- Referential, lines 5-6.
- The text features referential function in lines 11-12.

## What elements of cultural context are needed to comprehend the humour in line 81? /2

- The cultural context needed to understand this line is that pop singer Pink has been on tour for a long time, and at the time the text was created was still performing at Rod Laver arena.

## Describe the register of the text. Reference language features from two different subsystems in your response. /4

- The text has a moderately informal register, as seen through short fragment responses like 'yep' and 'nope' that lower the formality. The conversation focuses on the field of sport, seen in "commentators" and "tennis".


Non-fluency features are not necessarily evidence of an informal register, rather they are a better indication of whether a text is planned or not.

- The register is relatively informal as shown through the use of colloquial lexemes such as "yup" and "yep" (line 57 and 67). In addition, the register includes terms from the field of housing such as “negative gearing” and “mortgage” in line 69 and “rents” in line 71.
- The register of this podcast is moderately informal and focuses on the semantic domain of sport. For example, short fragment responses like 'yep' and 'nope' lower the level of formality, and words like 'tennis' and 'commentators' reference the semantic domain of sport.

## Comment on the non-fluency features and what their presence indicates. Use specific examples in your response.  /3

- Non-fluency features such as repetition such as "and and" (62) and filled pauses "um" (85). Furthermore, there are examples of backchanneling "yup. Yup" (49). These features indicate spontaneous speech, a lack formality and understanding of the utterances.
- Some of the non-fluency features in this text are filled pauses, false starts, and repetition. Some examples of filled pauses are "uh" (line 26), and "uhm" (line 37), and are indicative of spontaneous speech and not scripted speech. This is also evidenced by false starts, such as "our elderly, the elderly uh, citizenry" (line 48), and repetition, such as "and and" (line 62). These are all indicating that Cam and Dave are not reading off of a script, and are instead speaking spontaneously and unplanned.

## How is inference essential in comprehending this text? /2

Inference is needed to understand the text because not all background information is provided to the audience. For example, the text does not explicitly introduce who Rod Laver is, and how he relates to the Rod Laver arena. Inference from the conversation "was called... center court... it became Rod Laver Arena" implies that the arena was named after him.

Also, the authors mentioned singers and bands when discussing the arena, needing background information about how Pink and Coldplay (line 80 and 85) are performers. If you don't know this, you are unlikely to understand what they are referencing in the conversation.


Response needs to be specific and not a general statement.

- Inference is essential to understanding the text because not all the background information is provided to fully understand what is being talked about without a little bit of background knowledge. For example, you need to know who Rod Laver is and his relationship to the Rod Laver Arena is. It is not explicitly stated in the text that the arena is named after Rod Laver himself. Dave said that "it became Rod Laver Arena" (line 22 & 24), and later on Cam says "the camera kept flashing to, to the great Rod Laver" (line 30). It is therefore inferred that the arena was named after him, as is aided by comments such as "in his house" (line 37) and "Do you suppose, for tax purposes, it's set-up like a holiday house" (line 64), even if it is not explicitly stated.
- Dave and Cam commonly mention singers/bands when discussing Rod Laver Arena. You need the context of performers being at Rod Laver, such as Pink (line 80 and 81) and Coldplay (line 85). If you do not take this inference, you are unlikely to understand what they are referencing in their conversation.

## Identify one of the purposes of this text and 3 language features that support this purpose. /4

One purpose of this text is to entertain the audience in a discussion about the Rod Laver Arena. This is done through the speakers using emphatic stress to show the humour of saying the arena is "his house" and the use of vocal effects like laughter creates a light-hearted atmosphere. THe 

- The purpose of this text is to entertain listeners through a discussion of the Rod Laver Arena. This is achieved through the use of emphatic stress to highlight the humour of the commentators referring to the arena as “his house” (lines 33, 37 and 56); the use of vocal effects such as laughter (lines 7 and 34-35) to create a light-hearted atmosphere and help signal jokes; and jokingly replicating the discourse conventions or structure of an Air Bnb ad in lines 87-98 to further emphasise the joke about the arena being Rod Laver’s house.

## Classify the tenor between the two hosts. Include reference to social distance, register, power dynamics and an adjective to describe the tenor overall. /4

Ensure all three parts of the instructions are responded to.

- The social distance between the two hosts is close and the power dynamic is fairly equal as it seems that they are good friends. The overall tenor is highly casual.
- The social status and power dynamics between Cam and Dave are relatively equal as they are both hosts of equal social status. The social distance between them is relatively close, are they have informal colloquial language when conversing. The register of the conversation is relatively informal and the tenor is casual.
- The power difference is low and the social distance is close. The register is informal, showing that they are able to communicate openly with informal language, giving us the impression that they are close, the tenor overall seems friendly.

## Outline the field of the text and three nouns and/or verbs that are part of this field. /2

- The field is Australian tennis. Examples are National Tennis Centre (6), Centre Court (14) and Rod Laver (30).
- The field of the text relates to housing: Mortgage (69), accommodation (87) and rents (68).
- The field of the text is sport as shown by the words tennis (28), commentators (32) and game (62).

## How does the use of prosodics support the intents of the authors? /5

The authors used prosodics with stress and intonation to highlight the important adjectives, such as the word "tremendous" in line 10, demonstrating the intentional emphasis on how tremendous it is.  Similarly, the use of slow speed such as in line 91 "seventy bathrooms" is a strategic use of tempo that effectively demonstrates how unbelievable it is that the arena has a huge amount of bathrooms. The use of falling intonation in line 26, supports that Cam is being quite serious rather than using sarcasm.

The emphatic stress on the "men" in "tremendous" (10) accentuates that Dave believes that it was actually truly tremendous, and he wasn't implying sarcasm.

The pauses at the end of line 1 allow for time for the audience and other host to digest the information being stated, and makes it more emphasised.

- The interlocuters use prosodics like volume and intonation, to emphasise certain points made such as on line 10, the words 'tremendous' has emphasis on it, to highlight that specifically. And even on line 11, the indication of increase in intonation at the end of "then" suggests that the author wants to continue saying something and that more will come. Tempo is also used in various ways throughout the text, an example is on line 33 the sentence "his house" is emphasised and also slow paced suggesting that the author wanted to really explain that certain point and make sure that the other person and audience fully understand that.
- The use of falling intonation in line 26, supports that Cam is being quite serious rather than using sarcasm. The slow paced utterance on "Rod Laver Arena" (23) emphasises that Cam understands what Dave was saying and was backchanneling to manifest that. The emphatic stress on the "men" in "tremendous" (10) accentuates that Dave believes that it was actually truly tremendous, and he wasn't implying sarcasm. The medium pauses at the end of line 1, allow for time for the audience and other host to digest the information being stated, helping with the intent of the statement, and making it more emphasised. The laughter in line 7, indicates that Dave comprehended the advertent jest Cam made about the location of Melbourne park. It is a minimal response used to allow Cam to know that he is alert in the conversation.
