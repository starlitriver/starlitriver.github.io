Phonetics is ==the study of physical properties of spoken sounds.==
```

The international phonetic alphabet (IPA) is a phonetic notation system the represents all the possible physical sounds in human speech.

### consonant classification

A consonant is a sound when airflow is relatively obstructed or restricted.

#### manner of articulation

A manner of articulation is a way a consonant sound is made. Includes plosive, nasal, fricative, affricate, lateral and approximant.
- Plosive (also stop) - a complete stop and then explosion of air. Eg "b" and "p".
- Nasal - Air goes through your nose. Eg "m" and "n".
- Fricative - You narrow something, causing friction in the air. Eg "f".
- Affricate - Starts as plosive but then transitions into fricative when released. Eg "tʃ" and "dʒ".
- Lateral - Air passes around the tongue. Eg "l".
- Approximant - Very little obstruction in air flow. Also semivowels. Eg "w" and "r".

#### place of articulation

A place of articulation is the physical location where a consonant sound is produced. Locations include the bilabial, dental, labiodental, alveolar, palato-alveolar, palatal, velar, glottal and labial-velar.

- bilabial
- dental
- labiodental
- alveolar
- palato-alveolar
- palatal
- velar
- glottal
- labial-velar

## vowel classification

A vowel is a sound when airflow is relatively unrestricted.

- roundedness
- height
- backness

There are two types of vowels: monophthongs and diphthongs. Monophthongs are vowels that only have one sound. . E.g. Glitter = [ɡlɪtə]

Diphthongs are vowels that have a noticeable change in quality/sound. Basically two vowels in a row. E.g. Clear = [klɪə]

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Vowel Sound|/ɪ/ as in 'hid'|/æ/ as in 'bat'|/ə/ as in 'about'|/ʊ/ as in 'put'|/e/ as in 'bet'|/ɒ/ as in 'cloth'|
|Vertical Tongue Position|close|open-mid/open|mid|close|close-mid|open|
|Horizontal Tongue Position|front|front|central|back|front|back|
|Rounded/Unrounded|unrounded|unrounded|unrounded|rounded|unrounded|rounded|

## connected speech processes

Connected speech processes are changes in pronunciation for ease of articulation.

Assimilation is making one sound sound more similar to a neighboring sound.

Eg "that guy" /ðæt ɡaɪ/ can become [ðæk ɡaɪ]. The alveolar /t/ becomes velar [k] before the velar /ɡ/.

Vowel reduction is reducing the quality of a vowel sound.

Elision is dropping a sound.

Insertion is adding a sound where there shouldn't be one.

## phonology
