A register is a language variation across subsystems like lexicon, grammar and pronunciation, used for a particular situation.

We always describe the register of a text with how formal it is.

One model describes five register styles in spoken English:
- Frozen: Also referred to as static register. Printed unchanging language, such as biblical quotations; often contains archaisms. Examples are the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America and other "static" vocalizations. The wording is exactly the same every time it is spoken.
- Formal: One-way participation; no interruption; technical vocabulary or exact definitions are important; includes presentations or introductions between strangers.
- Consultative: Two-way participation; background information is provided â€“ prior knowledge is not assumed. "Back-channel behavior" such as "uh huh", "I see", etc. is common. Interruptions are allowed. For example teacher/student, doctor/patient, or expert/apprentice.
- Casual: In-group friends and acquaintances; no background information provided; ellipsis and slang common; interruptions common. This is common among friends in a social setting.
- Intimate: Non-public; intonation more important than wording or grammar; private vocabulary. Also includes non-verbal messages. This is most common among family members and close friends.
