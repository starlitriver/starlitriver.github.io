The sociolinguistic variables are cultural context, register, audience, purpose, and situational context. You can remember them with "CRAPS".

The sociolinguistic variables are ==cultural context, register, audience, purpose, and situational context.==
```

## cultural context

Different cultures have different words for things, reflecting their unique experiences and stuff. Even within Australia, people from different places use English differently.

## register

A [[register]] is a language variation across subsystems like lexicon, grammar and pronunciation, used for a particular situation.

A formal register means more formal words and less contractions.

## audience

The [[audience]] significantly influence your language choices. Obviously.

## purpose

The purpose is reason why you are communicating. What are you trying to achieve?

## situational context

The situational context is the environment in which you communicate.

You would speak differently at a funeral than you would at a birthday party. Hopefully.
