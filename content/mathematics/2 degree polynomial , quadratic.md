A quadratic (better to say 2 degree polynomial) has a leading term of $ax^2$.

A quadratic can be in standard form, turning point form or product form.


The graph of a quadratic is called a parabola. The graph has:
- either a positive or negative shape
- one y-intercept
- x-intercepts, also called roots
- a turning point  a point on the graph, either the maximum or minimum
- an axis of symmetry that includes the turning point
`

## standard form

$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$
- the sign of $a$ determines the shape
- the axis of symmetry is $x=\dfrac{-b}{2a}$
- find the x-intercepts with $y=0$
- find the turning point with axis of symmetry or with x-intercepts

A quadratic in standard form is $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. The axis of symmetry is ==$x=\dfrac{-b}{2a}$==.
```

## turning point form

$f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$
- the sign of $a$ determines the shape
- $(h,k)$ is the turning point
- the y intercept is at  $(0,ah^2+k)$
- find the x-intercepts by substituting $y=0$

A quadratic in turning point form is ==$f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$==. The turning point
```

## product form

$f(x)=a(xâˆ’m)(x-n)$
- the sign of $a$ determines the shape
- where a and b are constants
- x-intercepts are are $(m,0)$ and $(n,0)$
