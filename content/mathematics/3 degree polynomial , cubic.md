A cubic (better to say 3 degree polynomial) is not to be confused with [[trinomial]].


The graph of a cubic is called a cubic graph. The graph has:
- a inflection point


A cubic has an inflection point, which is the point at which the gradient changes sign (negative or positive)

#### standard form

$f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$
where a b c d are constants

#### turning point form

$f(x)=a(x-h)^3+k$
where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ is the inflection point of the equation

#### product form

$𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎(𝑥 − 𝑥_1)(𝑥 − 𝑥_2)(𝑥 − 𝑥_3)$
