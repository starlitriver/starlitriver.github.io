In differentiation, Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The most basic version starts with a real-valued function f, its derivative fâ€², and an initial guess x0 for a root of f. If f satisfies certain assumptions and the initial guess is close, then $x_1=x_0-\dfrac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$ is a better approximation of the root than x0. Geometrically, (x1, 0) is the x-intercept of the tangent of the graph of f at (x0, f(x0)): that is, the improved guess, x1, is the unique root of the linear approximation of f at the initial guess, x0.
