in algebra, a binomial is a [[polynomial]] with two terms

the binomial $x^2-y^2$ is called difference of two squares
$x^2-y^2=(x-y)(x+y)$

> this is a special case of the formula $\displaystyle x^{n+1}-y^{n+1}=(x-y)\sum _{k=0}^{n}x^{k}y^{n-k}$
> for imaginary numbers, $\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=x^{2}-(iy)^{2}=(x-iy)(x+iy)$

the product of two linear binomials is a trinomial
$\displaystyle (ax+b)(cx+d)=acx^{2}+(ad+bc)x+bd$
