## calculus

[[guide to calculus]]

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change.
It is a broad concept used to understand rates of change and accumulation of values.

The core of differential calculus is the [[derivative , differentitation|derivative]].
The derivative is an operation that quantifies the sensitivity of change of a function's output, used to find the rate of change.
Differentiation is finding the derivative, so this is what differential calculus is all about - the derivative.

## integral calculus

The core of integral calculus is the [[calculus , differential calculus , integral calculus|integral]].
The integral is an operation that calculates the continuous analog of a sum, useful for calculating areas and volumes.
Integral calculus studies integrals in order to calculate accumulated area
