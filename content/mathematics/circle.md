a circle is a shape consisting of all points on a plane that are at a given distance from a given point
the given distance the radius and the given point is the center

## terminology

### annulus

a ring shaped object, the region bounded by two concentric circles

### arc

any connected part of a circle. specifying two points 

### center

the point equidistant from all points on the circle. also called the origin of the circle

### chord

a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle

### circumference

the length of one circuit along the circle

### diameter

a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and passes through the center
the length of this line segment is also called the diameter

### radius

a line segment joining the center with any point on the circle
the length of this line segment is also called the radius

### sector

a region bounded by two radii with a common center and one of the two possible arcs

### segment

a region bounded by a chord and one of the two possible arcs connecting the chord's endpoints

### secant

a chord but is a line instead of a line segment

### tangent

a line that only has one point in common with the circle
