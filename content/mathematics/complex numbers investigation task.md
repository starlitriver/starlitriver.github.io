Investigate the solutions of the equations of the form $z^n=2^n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

For example $z^1=2^1$, $z^2=2^2$, $z^3=2^3$, etc.

As part of your investigation:

- determine the solutions when n=1,2,3,4....
- plot solutions of the equations in Argand diagrams
- represent some of the solutions in Cartesian form and some in polar form, whatever is most appropriate
- look for patterns in the solutions depending on the values of n, such as how many solutions there are, the angle between the solutions etc.
- summarize your findings in a final paragraph

You may use CAS but show working out.
