[[guide to differentiability]]

Differentiability determines if something can be differentiated.

The black lines are your tangent lines, the things that you try to calculate when you differentiate. What makes a point not differentiable?

- Not continuous - if a point is not continuous, then it is impossible to calculate the slope of the point.
- Sharp turn - if the slope is always positive on one side and always negative on one side. So the slope is undefined.
- Infinite slope - if a point has infinite slope, the slope is undefined, and so the slope is also undefined.
