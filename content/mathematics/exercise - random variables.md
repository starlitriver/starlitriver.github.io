## When a pair of dice is rolled, there are 36 equally likely outcomes. Let X denote the larger of the values showing on the dice. If both dice come up the same, then X denotes the common value. Find Pr(X=4).

X can be an integer in the range from 1 to 6.

For X=4 we have the things 14, 24, 34, and 44, and 41, 42, 43, resulting in 7 out of 36 chance.
