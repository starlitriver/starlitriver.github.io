in mathematics, function composition 

below is an example of a composite function, defined with many statements together
$f(a)=\begin{cases}x+1&\quad\text{if } a < 2\\2&\quad\text{if } a = 5\\3&\quad\text{if } a > 7\\\end{cases}$

composite functions that join two functions together use a symbol $\circ$ to indicate which functions make up the composite function
for example, the statement $h=g \circ f$ means that $h(x)=g(f(x))$
notice that function at the front takes the output of the other function as its input

if a composite function $h$ joins two exact same functions called $f$, $h$ can be depicted as $h(x)=(f\circ f)(x)=f(f(x))=f^2(x)$
