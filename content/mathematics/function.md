in mathematics, a function is a [[relation]] that is either a one-to-one relation or a many-to-one relation

## introduction

a function is a relation with one input set $X$ and one output set $Y$
set $X$ is called the domain and set $Y$ is called the codomain or range
in other words, a function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ assigns to each element of $X$ 

let two sets $X$ and $Y$ be given. let $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$
a function $f$ is given on $X$ and the variable $y$ is a function of the variable $x$, therefore can be shown as $f(x)$

a function $f(x)$ is defined with the use of [[equation|equations]] and cannot be defined with 

for example, if a function $f$ inputs $x$ and outputs $x^2$, the formal representation is $f:\mathbb{R}\to[0,\infty),x\rightarrow f(x),f(x)=x^2$
$f$ is the name of the function
$\mathbb{R}$ is the domain of the function
$[0,\infty)$ is the codomain of the function
$x$ is the input of the function
$f(x)$ is the output of the function
and finally, the input and output are related with the equation $f(x)=x^2$

for short, we often just say $f(x)=x^2$ and everything else in the function syntax are implied

## composite functions

multiple functions can be combined in [[function composition]]

## multivariate functions

a multivariate function, also called a multivariable function,
is a [[relation]] that inputs or outputs more than one variable
a function that has more than one input or output technically does not count as a function

## inverse functions

a function $f$ has an [[inverse function]] $f^{-1}$ that can map the codomain onto the domain

## derivatives

the [[derivative , differentitation]] of a function $f(x)$ is a function $g(x)$ such that for any constant $c$ , $g(c)$ is equal to the [[slope]] of the tangent line at $f(c)$

## exponential function

a [[exponential function]]

## logarithmic function

a [[logarithmic function]]

## power function

a [[power function]]

## polynomials

a [[polynomial]]
