in a graph, we can travel along the things in the graph in analyzing them

a walk is any sequence of vertices of a graph along edges without restriction on sequence length or elements

a trail is a walk without repeated edges
a circuit is a trail that starts and finishes at the same vertex

a path is a walk with no repeated vertices
a cycle is a path that starts and finishes at the same vertex

an Eulerian trail is a trail that includes all the edges
an Eulerian circuit is a circuit that includes all the edges

a Hamiltonian path is a path that includes all vertices
a Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that includes all vertices

a traversable graph is a graph that has at least one Eulerian trail
