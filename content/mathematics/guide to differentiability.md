so, to recap the [[differentiability]] page, there are just 3 things that make something not differentiable
- if not continuous, not differentiable.
- sharp turn
- infinite slope

## graphical way

so if you have the graph, you can easily tell if a point on the function is differentiable.

## algebraic way
