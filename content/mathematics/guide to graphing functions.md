Graphing and sketching is a really big part of mathematics.


Firstly, we have a nice overview of all the types of graphs that you can expect to see, and there is a lot of them! Don't worry though, you can remember them.

## overview

### trig functions

[[how to graph trig functions]]

Trig functions are really beautiful. They appear everywhere in nature and are the very embodiment of energy and movement.

Anyway, they have amplitudes and periods.

### power functions

[[how to graph power functions]]

Power functions can be a pain because there can be so many exponents, and you have them in fractions and you have then negative and all that.

Oh well, there's a lot of them.

## polynomial 

[[how to graph polynomial functions]]

Polynomials are common in mathematics because they have a lot of factors, and the x and y intercepts of polynomials can be useful in application problems.
