## the derivative function has betrayed us

worked example: What is the equation of the tangent line to the graph of $f(x)=x^5+3x^2+2x$ at the point where $x=-1$?

We need to find $f'(x)$ first

$f'(x)=5x^4+6x+2$

Now we find $f'(-1)$

$f'(-1)=-9$

Now we know the slope is -9

but you know, we now graph $f(x)$ and the slope should be 1, not -9

what?

the explanation on khan academy is, is... what?
