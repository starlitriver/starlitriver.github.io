when we flip an angle over the line $y=x$, we have equations called complementary relationships

from the figure above, we can see that
$\cos(\theta)=\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-\theta)$
$\sin(\theta)=\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-\theta)$

apply this for a general rule, we see that for angle $\theta$, and $c$ is an odd integer:
$\sin(\theta)=\cos(c\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{2}\pm \theta)$
$\cos(\theta)=\sin(c\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{2}\pm \theta)$

### practice complementary relationships

worked example: if $\cos(a)=0.7$ and $\sin(b)=0.4$ and they are both in the first quadrant, evaluate $\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-a)$
$|\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-a)|=\cos(a)=0.7$
applying signs
since angle $a$ is in the first quadrant, $\dfrac{\pi}{2}-a$ is also in the first quadrant, where sine and cosine are both positive
$\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-a)=0.7$

worked example: if $\cos(a)=0.7$ and $\sin(b)=0.4$ and they are both in the second quadrant, evaluate $\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{2}+b)$
$|\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{2}+b)|=\sin(b)=0.4$
applying signs
since angle $b$ is in the second quadrant, $\dfrac{\pi}{2}+b$ is in the third quadrant, where sine and cosine are both negative
$\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{2}+b)=-0.4$

\worked example: if $\cos(a)=0.7$ and $\sin(b)=0.4$ and they are both in the third quadrant, evaluate $\sin(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}+a)$
$|\sin(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}+a)|=\cos(a)=0.7$
applying signs
since angle $a$ is in the third quadrant, $\dfrac{3\pi}{2}+a$ is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive and cosine is negative
$\sin(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)=0.7$

worked example: if $\cos(a)=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\sin(a)=\dfrac{1}{2}$ and angle $a$ is in the first quadrant, evaluate $\tan(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)$
$\tan(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)=\dfrac{\sin(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)}{\cos(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)}$
$|\sin(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)|=\cos(a)=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
$|\cos(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)|=\sin(a)=\dfrac{1}{2}$
applying signs 
since angle $a$ is in the first quadrant, $\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a$ is in the third quadrant, where sine and cosine are both negative, and tangent is positive
$\tan(\dfrac{3\pi}{2}-a)=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$
