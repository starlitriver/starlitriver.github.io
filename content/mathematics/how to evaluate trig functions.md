have a look at what [[trigonometric functions|trig functions]] are


it is important to be able to evaluate most trig function values without a calculator

it's a long journey ahead of us, and we'll learn all this step by step...

## common angles

[[how to evaluate trig functions for common angles]]

## sign

sine and cosine have the range $[-1,1]$, and we can divide that into four quadrants, to make evaluating trig functions much easier

looking at the unit circle, this is a table showing the signs of the outputs of trig functions for the quadrants

| quadrant | sin      | cos      | tan      |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1        | positive | positive | positive |
| 2        | positive | negative | negative |
| 3        | negative | negative | positive |
| 4        | negative | positive | negative |

we can make a shorter table that we need to remember. just remember the letters "ASTC"

| quadrant | what is positive |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 1        | all              |
| 2        | sin              |
| 3        | tan              |
| 4        | cos              |

this is important, because this is the easiest way to find out the sign of an angle. no matter what angle you have, if you know which quadrant the angle is, you know the sign of the sine, cosine and tan outputs
