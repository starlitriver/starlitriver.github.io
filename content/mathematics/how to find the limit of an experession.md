strategy to find $\lim\limits_{x\to a}[f(x)]$

## 1.1

directly substitute $x=a$ 

## 2.1

if $f(a)=\dfrac{b}{0}$ where $b$ is a constant that is not zero
solution - $\lim\limits_{x\to a}[f(x)]$ is at asymptote and does not exist

## 2.2

if $f(a)=b$ where $b$ is a constant
solution - $\lim\limits_{x\to a}[f(x)]$ 

## 2.3

if $f(a)=\dfrac{0}{0}$
try 3.1

## 3.1

simplify $f(x)$
- by factoring, find examples [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus/dc-limits/dc-limits-algebraic/e/two-sided-limits-using-algebra)
- with rationalization, find examples [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus/dc-limits/dc-limits-algebraic/e/limits_2)
- with trig identities, find examples [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus/dc-limits/dc-limits-algebraic/e/find-limits-using-trig-identities)
using simplified function, try 1.1
