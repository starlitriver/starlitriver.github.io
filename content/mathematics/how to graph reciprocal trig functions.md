worked example: graph $y=2\csc(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-\dfrac{\pi}{4})-2$
mean: y=-2
amplitude: 2
period: $4\pi$


worked example: graph $y=\sqrt{3}\cot(\dfrac{x}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4})-1$
$y=\sqrt{3}\cot\left(\dfrac{1}{2}(x+\dfrac{\pi}{2})\right)-1$
mean: y=-1
amplitude: $\sqrt{3}$
period: $2\pi$
start: solve for $\dfrac{1}{2}(x+\dfrac{\pi}{2})=0$ to get $x=\dfrac{\pi}{2}$
