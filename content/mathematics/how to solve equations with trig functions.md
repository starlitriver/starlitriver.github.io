worked example: Solve $\sin(3x)=\dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\cos(3x)$ for $x\in[-\pi,\pi]$


worked example: Solve $2\cos^2(x)-3\cos(x)+1=0$ for $x\in[-\pi,2\pi)$



worked example: Solve $2\cos(x-\dfrac{\pi}{3})+1=0$ for a general solution.

The first step is to isolate the trig function.

$\cos(x-\dfrac{\pi}{3})=-\dfrac{1}{2}$

Think of an angle for which the trig function can input it

Since this is cosine, and ASTC, we know that there can be a solution in the second and third quadrants.

second quadrant: $\cos(\pi-\dfrac{\pi}{3})=-\dfrac{1}{2}$ so $x=\pi$
third quadrant: $\cos(\pi+\dfrac{\pi}{3})=-\dfrac{1}{2}$ so $x=\dfrac{5\pi}{3}$

Now we found all the solutions throughout the quadrants. $x=\pi\lor x=\dfrac{5\pi}{3}$

It's time to make general solutions.

We know we can add as many $2\pi$ as we want to an angle, so therefore we add $+2k\pi$ where $k$ is an integer.

general solution: $x=\pi+2k\pi\lor x=\dfrac{5\pi}{3}+2k\pi$






worked example: The temperature in a city, $T$ degrees Celsius, at $t$ hours after midnight, is $T(t)=16-7\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{12}\cdot t)$. what is the temperature at 10:00?
$T(10)=16-7\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{12}\cdot 10)$
$T(10)=16-7\sin(\dfrac{5\pi}{6})$
$T(10)=16-7\sin(\dfrac{\pi}{6})$
$T(10)=16-7\cdot\dfrac{1}{2}$
$T(10)=12.5$ (degrees Celsius)




worked example: An elevator moves in a straight line. its height above the ground, $x$ meters, at $t$ seconds is $x(t)=2+4\cos(2t)$.
- what is the elevator's max height?
$2+4=6$
- at what time for $t>0$ will the elevator first reach the max height?
we need to find the smallest value of $t$ for $t>0$ that gives $\cos(2t)=1$
$\cos(0)=1$
$\cos(\pi)=-1$
$\cos(2\pi)=1$
$2t=2\pi$
$t=\pi$
the elevator will first reach the max height at $\pi$ seconds




worked example: $h(t)=3\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{6}\cdot t)$ represents the water height, $h(t)$, meters above sea level, at $t$ hours after midnight. During what time intervals is the water level at least 1.5 meters above sea level?

to answer this question, we want to solve the inequality $3\cos(\dfrac{\pi}{6}\cdot t)>1.5$


this inequality is best solved by graphing!

amplitude is 3, period is 12

worked example: The equation $3\sin(x)-1=b$ has 1 solution in the interval $x\in(0,2\pi)$. What values can $b$ be?
a solution means a point where $x=0$
as $b$ changes, the value of $x$ changes from the formula $3\sin(x)-1=b$
