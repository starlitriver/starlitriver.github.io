in mathematics, an inequality is a [[relation]] that makes it a non-equal comparison between two mathematical [[expression|expressions]]

there are many kinds of inequalities:

$a<b$ means that $a$ is less than $b$
$a>b$ means that $a$ is greater than $b$
$a\leq b$ means that $a$ is less than or equal to $b$
$a\geq b$ means that $a$ is greater than or equal to $b$
$a\neq b$ means that $a$ is not equal to $b$

inequalities have some similar qualities as [[equation|equations]], for inequalities can be solved, and also be used to graph relationships between variables

if an inequality has one unknown variable in it, solving the inequality means to find all possible values that the variable can be
