An integral is an [[operation]] that calculates the continuous analog of a sum, useful for calculating areas and volumes.

A definite integral calculates the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the line.

Areas above the x-axis are considered positive and those below are considered negative
the integral of a functions is the positive signed area minus the negative signed area.

Some identities.

$\int x^n dx = \dfrac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1} + c,n\neq-1$

$\int e^{ax} dx = \dfrac{1}{a}e^{ax} + c$

$\int \dfrac{1}{x} dx = \ln(|x|) + c$

$\int \sin(ax) dx = -\dfrac{1}{a}\cos(ax) + c$

$\int \cos(ax) dx = \dfrac{1}{a}\sin(ax) + c$

$\int \sec^2(ax) dx = \dfrac{1}{a}\tan(ax) + c$

$\int \csc^2(ax) dx = -\dfrac{1}{a}\cot(ax) + c$

$\int \sec(ax)\tan(ax) dx = \dfrac{1}{a}\sec(ax) + c$

$\int \csc(ax)\cot(ax) dx = -\dfrac{1}{a}\csc(ax) + c$

$\int \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} dx = \sin^{-1}\left(\dfrac{x}{a}\right) + c, \quad a > 0$

$\int \dfrac{-1}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} dx = \cos^{-1}\left(\dfrac{x}{a}\right) + c, \quad a>0$

$\int \dfrac{1}{a^2 + x^2} dx = \dfrac{1}{a}\tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{x}{a}\right) + c$

$\int (ax + b)^n dx = \dfrac{1}{a(n+1)}(ax + b)^{n+1} + c, \quad n \neq -1$

$\int(ax + b)^{-1} dx = \dfrac{1}{a}\ln(|ax + b|) + c$
