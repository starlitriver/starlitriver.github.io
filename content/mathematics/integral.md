An integral is an [[operation]] that calculates the continuous analog of a sum, useful for calculating areas and volumes.

a definite integral calculates the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the line

areas above the x-axis are considered positive and those below are considered negative
the integral of a functions is the positive signed area minus the negative signed area
