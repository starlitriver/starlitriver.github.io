in mathematics, the irrational numbers are all the real numbers that are not rational numbers
that is, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two [[integer|integers]]

some examples of irrational numbers are $\pi$ and $\sqrt2$

the irrational number that use the root operator can actually be expressed as exponent form

irrational numbers can be treated as variables in their own right, for example $\pi$ and $e$ - we treat them as variables
but in real world applications it is possible to treat them as decimals for rough estimations

one might prefer to see a number such as $\sqrt2$ as $(2)^{0.5}\lor 2^\dfrac{1}{2}$ to make the calculation steps clearer

like variables, irrational numbers can have coefficients. $\sqrt2$ is an irrational number, and when you double it to get $2\sqrt2$ it is still an irrational number.

irrational numbers can be simplified with the use of perfect squares and factoring.
$\sqrt{4} = 2$
$\sqrt8 = \sqrt{4\cdot2} = 2\sqrt2$
$\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16\cdot2} = 4\sqrt2$

likewise, they can be unsimplified when you convert the coefficient into it
$2\sqrt2 = \sqrt{4\cdot2} = \sqrt8$
$4\sqrt2 = \sqrt{16\cdot2} = \sqrt{32}$

as $a^{\dfrac{1}{b}}=\sqrt[b]{a}$, operations involving irrational numbers can be done by following the exponent rules/

just like variables, like terms can be collected.
$\sqrt7 + \sqrt7 = 2 \sqrt7$

unlike terms cannot be collected.
$\sqrt2 + \sqrt7 = \sqrt2 + \sqrt7$

when there are many different irrationals, make sure that you get the calculations right
$\sqrt2 + \sqrt7 - \sqrt5 + \sqrt2 - 4 \sqrt7 = 2\sqrt2-\sqrt5-3\sqrt7$

like terms may combine

$\sqrt7 \cdot \sqrt7 = 7$
$(7)^{0.5} \cdot (7)^{0.5} = (7^{0.5})^{2} = 7^{0.5\cdot2}= 7^{1}= 7$

coefficients may combine
$2\sqrt7 \cdot 7\sqrt7 = 2\cdot7\cdot7 = 98$

unlike terms may be rearranged
$2\sqrt{12} \cdot \sqrt{48} = 2\sqrt{4\cdot3} \cdot \sqrt{4\cdot4\cdot3} = 4\sqrt3\cdot4\sqrt3 = 4\cdot4\cdot3 = 48$
