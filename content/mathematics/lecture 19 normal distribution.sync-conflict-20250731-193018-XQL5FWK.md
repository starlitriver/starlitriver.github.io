## The random variable, X, has a normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 0.25. If the random variable, Z, has the standard normal distribution, then the probability that X is greater than 13 is equal to what probability of Z?

| 11.75 | 12  | 12.25 | 12.5 | 12.75 | 13  |
| ----- | --- | ----- | ---- | ----- | --- |
| -1    | 0   | 1     | 2    | 3     | 4   |

$Pr(Z>4)$

## Let X be a normally distributed random variable, with a mean of 15. If the standard deviation is a third of the mean value, find the approximate value of Pr(10≤X≤25).

| 10  | 15  | 20  | 25  | 30  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -1  | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |

Pr(10≤X≤25) = 0.682+0.136=0.818

## Suppose X is normally distributed with mean μ=50 and standard deviation σ=10, Z is a standard normal random variable.  Pr(−2.5<Z<1.5) is equal to what probability of X?

| -2.5 | -1.5 | -0.5 | 0.5 | 1.5 | 2.5 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 25   | 35   | 45   | 55  | 65  | 75  |

Pr(−2.5<Z<1.5) = Pr(25<X<65) = Pr(35<X<75)

## The average amount of time a year 12 student sleeps for at night is 7 hours with a variance of b hours. Given that the probability a student sleeps for more than 9 hours is the same as Pr(Z<−1), where Z is the standard normal random variable, find the value of b.

| $7-\sqrt{b}$ | 7   | $7+\sqrt{b}$ | $7+2\sqrt{b}$ | $7+3\sqrt{b}$ |
| ------------ | --- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| -1           | 0   | 1            | 2             | 3             |

Pr(Z<−1) = Pr($X > 7+\sqrt{b}$) = Pr(X>9)

$7+\sqrt{b}=9$
$\sqrt{b}=2$
$b=4$

## Let X be a normally distributed random variable, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 34. Find Pr(X≤134)

| 100 | 134 |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   |

Pr(X≤134) = Pr(Z≤1) = 0.997/2 + 0.34 = 0.8413

## Suppose X is normally distributed with mean μ=20 and standard deviation σ=4, Z is a standard normal random variable. Find the value of b such that Pr(X≤12)=Pr(Z>b).

| 12  | 16  | 20  | 24  | 28  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -2  | -1  | 0   | 1   | 2   |

Pr(X≤12) = Pr(X<12) = Pr(Z>b) = Pr(Z<-2) = Pr(Z>2)
$b=2$

## The random variable, X, has a normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 0.25. If the random variable, Z, has the standard normal distribution, then the probability that X is greater than 12.5 is equal to what probability of Z?


| 11.5 | 12  | 12.5 | 13  |
| ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
| -2   | 0   | 2    | 4   |

Pr(X>12.5) = Pr(Z>2)


## The random variable X has a normal distribution with mean 148 and standard deviation 12. If Z has the standard normal distribution, then the probability that Z is less than −2.5 is equal to:


| 118  | 136 | 148 | 160 |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| -2.5 | -1  | 0   | 1   |


Pr(Z<-2.5) = Pr(X<118) = Pr(X>178)


## A spelling test out of 100 for Year 6s gives a set of scores that are normally distributed with a mean of 60 and a variance of 100. If the passing mark is 55, find the probability that a student who passes obtains a score of more than 65. 



| 55   | 60  | 65  |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| -0.5 | 0   | 0.5 |



## If X is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and Pr(X>18)=0.916, calculate the variance. 





## Suppose X is normally distributed with mean μ=50 and standard deviation σ=10, Z is a standard normal random variable. Pr(−2<Z<1) is equal to: 



| 30  | 40  | 50  | 60  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -2  | -1  | 0   | 1   |

Pr(−2<Z<1) = Pr(30<X<60) = Pr(40<X<70



## Let X be a normally distributed random variable with a mean of 12 and a variance of 3 . Let Z be a random variable with the standard normal distribution. Find a such that Pr(X>15)=Pr(Z<a).
