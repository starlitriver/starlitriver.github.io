## Solve $\sqrt{2x+5}>x+1$.

Best way is to graph the equations, and graphically solve for the solution range. That always works.

Not recommended to use below method.

Restrict $2x+5\geq 0$
$x\geq \dfrac{-5}{2}$

$\sqrt{2x+5}>x+1$

Maybe assume both sides are positive, and square both sides.

$2x+5>x^2+2x+1$
$0>x^2-4$
$0>(x+2)(x-2)$

This means $-2<x<2$

Therefore.

$x\in[-\dfrac{-5}{2},2)$

## Graph $f(x)=\dfrac{6}{\sqrt{9-3x}}+1$.

Rewrite.
$f(x)=a[b(x-h)]^n+k$

$f(x)=6[-3(x-3)]^{\dfrac{-1}{2}}+1$

Recall the 9 classes of power functions table.

Step one find the asymptotes. They are $x=3$ and $y=1$

There is a reflection in y axis, as seen in $-3$.

Now we know how to graph it yay.

## Find domain and range of $y=-(3-x)^{\dfrac{3}{4}}-1$.

Endpoint at $(3,-1)$.

We know the shape of a power function that is between 0 and 1 and is odd on even. This one is reflected in both the x axis and y axis.

The domain is $(-\infty,3]$ and the range is $(-\infty,-1]$.

## Find the domain of $y=\sqrt{1-4x^2}$.

Restrict.

$1-4x^2\geq0$
$4x^2\leq1$
$x^2\leq \dfrac{1}{4}$
$-\dfrac{1}{2}\leq x\leq\dfrac{1}{2}$

## Find domain and range of $y=\sqrt{2x^2-9x-5}$.

Restrict.

$2x^2-9x-5\geq0$

We can graph the quadratic $2x^2-9x-5=0$ and find where the graph $\geq0$.

Has positive shape.

$(2x+1)(x-5)=0$

X-intercepts $x=5$ and $x=\dfrac{-1}{2}$

Therefore the domain of y is $x\in(-\infty,\dfrac{-1}{2}]\cup[5,\infty)$

Now find range of y. The things under square root always $\geq0$, so the range is $[0,\infty)$.

## Find asymptotes of the function $f(x)=\dfrac{x+4}{2x-3}$.

First we need to rearrange. Umm [[linear over linear]] is something used in this step.

$f(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{11}{2(2x-3)}$

Therefore the asymptotes are $x=\dfrac{3}{2}$ and $y=\dfrac{1}{2}$

## Let $f(x)=\dfrac{3}{(x+1)^3}-2$. Find asymptotes of $f^{-1}$.

We don't even need to find inverse. The original asymptotes are $x=-1$ and $y=-2$, so the inverse has the asymptotes $x=-2$ and $y=-1$.

But to find f inverse just for practice...
$x=\dfrac{3}{(y+1)^3}-2$

$(y+1)^3=\dfrac{3}{x+2}$
$y=(\dfrac{3}{x+2})^{\dfrac{1}{3}}-1$
$y=3^{\dfrac{1}{3}}(x+2)^{\dfrac{-1}{3}}-1$

## The lines $y=-ax+1$ and $y=\dfrac{-x}{3}+2b$ are inverse of each other. Find values of a and b.

Equation one. $y=-ax+1$. The inverse of equation one is  $y=\dfrac{x-1}{-a}$. And this is the same as $y=\dfrac{-x}{3}+2b$. We have an equation now.

$\dfrac{x-1}{-a}=\dfrac{-x}{3}+2b$
$\dfrac{-x+1}{a}=\dfrac{-x}{3}+2b$
$\dfrac{-x}{a}+\dfrac{1}{a}=\dfrac{-x}{3}+2b$

Equating coefficients.

$a=3$
$\dfrac{1}{a}=2b$
$b=\dfrac{1}{6}$

## Let $f:(n,\infty)\to\mathbb{R},f(x)=\dfrac{m}{(x-n)^2}$ and $m.n\in\mathbb{R^+}$. Find the rule and domain and range of $f^{-1}$.

So function f is a hyperbola with the asymptotes $x=n$ and $y=0$ and the domain restriction $x>n$. The range is therefore $(0,\infty)$.

The inverse function will have asymptotes $x=0$ and $y=n$.

For inverse.

$x=\dfrac{m}{(y-n)^2}$
$y-n=\pm\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{x}}$
$f^{-1}(x)=n\pm\sqrt{\dfrac{m}{x}}$

From the domain and range of f, the inverse function has range $(n,\infty)$ and domain $(0,\infty)$.

## Given $h(x)=\dfrac{4x}{5-x}$ and $f(x)=h^{-1}(x)$, find $f(2)$ and state whether f is increasing or decreasing at the point.

Rearrange with [[linear over linear]].

$h(x)=-4+\dfrac{20}{5-x}$

Find f.

$x=-4+\dfrac{20}{5-y}$
$x+4=\dfrac{20}{5-y}$
$5-y=\dfrac{20}{x+4}$
$y-5=\dfrac{-20}{x+4}$
$y=\dfrac{-20}{x+4}+5$
$f(x)=\dfrac{-20}{x+4}+5$


$f(2)=\dfrac{5}{3}$

Graph is a hyperbola with middle point at $(-4,5)$ and reflected once. You can visualize this and find that the slope is always positive when $x>-4$. Therefore it is increasing at the point.

## Given $h(x)=\dfrac{4x}{5-x}$ and $f(x)=h^{-1}(x)$, find $f(2)$ and state whether f is increasing or decreasing at the point.

$x=\dfrac{4y}{5-y}$
Rearrange.

$x=-4+\dfrac{20}{5-y}$
$x+4=\dfrac{20}{5-y}$
$5-y=\dfrac{20}{x+4}$
$y-5=\dfrac{-20}{x+4}$
$f(x)=-20(x+4)^{-1}+5$
$f(x)=\dfrac{5}{3}$

Visualize the graph. The graph has a positive slope when $x>-4$.

## Given $h(x)=(2x+11)^{\dfrac{1}{5}}$ and $f(x)=h^{-1}(x)$, find $f(2)$ and state whether f is increasing or decreasing at the point.

$x=(2y+11)^{\dfrac{1}{5}}$
$f(x)=\dfrac{x^5-11}{2}$
$f(2)=\dfrac{21}{2}$

Try to visualize. The graph has a positive slope at the point.

## Given $h(x)=(x-2)^3+1$ and $f(x)=h^{-1}(x)$, find $f(3)$ and state whether f is increasing or decreasing at the point.

$x=(y-2)^3+1$
$(x-1)^{\dfrac{1}{3}}=y-2$
$f(x)=(x-1)^{\dfrac{1}{3}}+2$

$f(3)=2^{\dfrac{1}{3}}+2$

The graph of f has a middle point $(1,2)$ and we know the shape of power function with exponent between 0 and 1 and is odd over odd. At $x>1$ the slope is positive.

## Given $h(x)=\dfrac{1+2x}{x+7}$ and $f(x)=h^{-1}(x)$, find $f(3)$ and state whether f is increasing or decreasing at the point.

$x=\dfrac{1+2y}{y+7}$
$x=2+\dfrac{-13}{y+7}$
$y+7=\dfrac{-13}{x-2}$
$f(x)=\dfrac{-13}{x-2}-7$
$f(3)=-20$

Visualize the graph with the asymptotes. When $x>2$ the slope is positive.

## Let $h:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R},h(x)=\dfrac{7}{x+2}-3$. Find $h^{-1}$.

$x=\dfrac{7}{y+2}-3$
$y+2=\dfrac{7}{x+3}$
$h^{-1}(x)=\dfrac{7}{x+3}-2$

## Find asymptotes of $f(x)=\dfrac{4-x}{2-x}$.

Rearrange with [[linear over linear]].

$f(x)=1+\dfrac{2}{2-x}$

Therefore asymptotes at $x=2$ and $y=1$.

## Find asymptotes of $f(x)=\dfrac{x+2}{5-x}$.

Rearrange with [[linear over linear]].

$f(x)=-1+\dfrac{7}{5-x}$

Therefore asymptotes at $x=5$ and $y=-1$.

## Find $g(x)=f(f^{-1}(x)-1)$ where $f(x)=3e^{1-x}$.

$x=3e^{1-y}$
$\dfrac{x}{3}=e^{1-y}$
$\ln(\dfrac{x}{3})=1-y$
$f^{-1}(x)=-\ln(\dfrac{x}{3})+1$

$g(x)=3e^{1-[-\ln(\dfrac{x}{3})+1-1]}$
$g(x)=3e^{1+\ln(\dfrac{x}{3})}$

$g(x)=3e^{\ln(e)+\ln(\dfrac{x}{3})}$

$g(x)=3\cdot e^{\ln(e\cdot\dfrac{x}{3})}$

$g(x)=3\cdot e^{\ln(\dfrac{ex}{3})}$

$g(x)=3(\dfrac{ex}{3})$
$g(x)=ex$

## Solve $\sqrt{2x-3}>x-3$. Without graphing.

We have a restriction $2x-3\geq0$ which is $x\geq \dfrac{3}{2}$.

Need three cases. Left hand side always positive, but right hand side could be anything.

Case $x-3>0$.
$\sqrt{2x-3}>x-3$
$2x-3>(x-3)^2$
$0>x^2-6x+9-2x+3$
$0>x^2-8x+12$
$0>(x-6)(x-2)$


Therefore x must be in $(2,6)$.

Remember to satisfy the case, $x\geq3$. And satisfy initial restriction too.

$x\in[3,6)$

Case $x-3=0$.
$\sqrt{2x-3}=x-3$
$0=(x-6)(x-2)$

$x=6\lor x=2$

Remember to satisfy the case, $x=3$. And satisfy initial restriction too.
No solutions for this case.


Case $x-3<0$.
All values of x will satisfy $\sqrt{2x-3}>x-3$.

Remember to satisfy the case, $x<3$. And satisfy initial restriction too.

$x\in[\dfrac{3}{2},3)$

Combine the three cases we found.

$x\in[\dfrac{3}{2},6)$

## Given $f:[-1,2]\to\mathbb{R},f(x)=-4x^3$ is one-to-one, find the domain of $f^{-1}$.

Since we know it is just one-to-one, the range of $f(x)$ is $[-32,4]$.

The domain of the inverse is also $[-32,4]$.

## Given $f:(1,2)\to\mathbb{R},f(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}x^4$ is one-to-one, find the domain of $f^{-1}$.

Since it is one-to-one, the range of f is $(\dfrac{1}{2},8)$.

The domain of the inverse is also $(\dfrac{1}{2},8$).

## Find domain and range of $f(x)=2-\sqrt{5+8x}$.

Restriction is $5+8x\geq0$ which is $x\geq \dfrac{-5}{8}$.

Domain is $[\dfrac{-5}{8},\infty)$.

The endpoint is $(\dfrac{-5}{8},2)$.

There is a reflection in x axis.

Therefore the range is $(-\infty,2]$.

## The function $f:(-\infty,a]\to\mathbb{R},f(x)=\ln(x^4)$ will have an inverse for what values of a?

F has a restriction $x^4>0$, and it is always satisfied. So all the domain is all numbers.

We need to restrict to get half of the function, there is asymptote at $x=0$ so we want $a<0$

## Let $f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ where a,b,c,d are positive. For what b will $f(x)$ have an inverse function?

For there to be an inverse function, the function needs to be one-to-one.

There can be at most one point where the derivative is zero.

$f'(x)=3ax^2+2bx+c$

A stationary point will mean $3ax^2+2bx+c=0$. And we can have at most one stationary point.

So we want the discriminant of this to be zero or negative.

$\Delta=b^2-4ac=4b^2-4(3ac)=4b^2-12ac$
$4b^2-12ac=0$ or $4b^2-12ac<0$
$b^2=3ac$ or $b^2<3ac$

We know that b is positive. No need take absolute value.
$b=\sqrt{3ac}$ or $b<\sqrt{3ac}$

Remember original restriction b is positive.
$0<b\leq\sqrt{3ac}$

## Let $f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ where a,b,c,d are negative. For what b will $f(x)$ not have an inverse function?

The function needs to be not one-to-one.

There is more than one point where derivative is zero.

$f'(x)=3ax^2+2bx+c$
$0=3ax^2+2bx+c$

Discriminant is positive.

$\Delta=4b^2-12ac$

$4b^2-12ac>0$
$b^2>3ac$
We know b is negative. Need to take absolute value.
$|b|>\sqrt{3ac}$
$b<-\sqrt{3ac}$ or $b>\sqrt{3ac}$
Remember original restriction b is negative.
$b<-\sqrt{3ac}$

## Let $f(x)=x^3-2x^2+ax-1$ and a is positive. For what a will $f(x)$ have inverse?

For there to be an inverse function, the function needs to be one-to-one.

There can be at most one point where the derivative is zero.

$f'(x)=3x^2-4x+a$
$0=3x^2-4x+a$

So we want the discriminant of this to be zero or negative.

$\Delta=16-4(3a)=16-12a$
$16-12a=0$ or $16-12a<0$
$a=\dfrac{4}{3}$ or $a>\dfrac{4}{3}$

$a\geq \dfrac{4}{3}$

## Let $f(x)=ax^3+2x^2-x-1$ and a is positive. For what a will $f(x)$ have inverse?

For there to be an inverse function, the function needs to be one-to-one.

There can be at most one point where the derivative is zero.

$f'(x)=3ax^2+4x-1$
$0=3ax^2+4x-1$

So we want the discriminant of this to be zero or negative.

$\Delta=16+12a$

$16+12a=0$ or $16+12a<0$
$a=\dfrac{-4}{3}$ or $a<\dfrac{-4}{3}$
Remember original restriction a is positive.
No solutions.

## Let $f(x)=x^3+3ax^2+ax+1$. For what a will $f(x)$ not have inverse?

For there to be no inverse, the function is not one-to-one.

There is more than one point where derivative is zero.

$f'(x)=3x^2+6ax+a$
$0=3x^2+6ax+a$

We want discriminant to be positive.
$\Delta=36a^2-4(3a)=36a^2-12a$
$36a^2-12a>0$
$3a^2-a>0$
$a(3a-1)>0$

Case $a>0$
$3a-1>0$
$a>\dfrac{1}{3}$
So $a>\dfrac{1}{3}$

Case $a=0$
$0>0$
Not possible.

Case $a<0$
$3a-1<0$
$a<\dfrac{1}{3}$
So $a<\dfrac{1}{3}$

$a>\dfrac{1}{3}$ or $a<\dfrac{1}{3}$

## Let $f(x)=x^3-ax^2+3x-1$. For what a will $f(x)$ have inverse?

For there to be an inverse function, the function needs to be one-to-one.

For a cubic polynomial to be one-to-one, there can be at most one point where the derivative is zero.

$f'(x)=3x^2-2ax+3$
$0=3x^2-2ax+3$

Discriminant must be zero or negative.

$\Delta=4a^2-4(9)=4a^2-36$
$4a^2-36=0$ or $4a^2-36<0$
$a^2=9$ or $a^2<9$
$a^2=9$ or $|a|<3$
$a^2=\pm3$ or $-3<a<3$

$a\in[-3,3]$

## For $f:(-\infty,0)\to\mathbb{R},f(x)=3-\dfrac{4}{\sqrt{1-x}}$, what is the domain and rule for inverse?

$x=3-\dfrac{4}{\sqrt{1-y}}$
$3-x=\dfrac{4}{\sqrt{1-y}}$
$\sqrt{1-y}=\dfrac{4}{3-x}$

$1-y=\dfrac{16}{(3-x)^2}$

$y-1=\dfrac{-16}{(3-x)^2}$

$f^{-1}(x)=\dfrac{-16}{(3-x)^2}+1$

The range of original is $(-1,3)$. The domain of inverse is also this.

## Given $f(x)=x^{m^2+2m-8}$ and $m\in\mathbb{Z}$, what values of m can make the function exist at $x=0$?

Since this is a power function and the power will be an integer, negative powers will make asymptotes, meaning that $m^2+2m-8\geq0$. Solving this, we get $m\in(-\infty,-4]\cup[2,\infty)$.
