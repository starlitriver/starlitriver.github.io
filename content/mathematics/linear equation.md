in algebra, a linear equation is an [[equation]] that is a straight line when graphed

the slope of a linear equation, often depicted as $m$, is calculated with rise over run, $\dfrac{b-d}{a-c}$ for $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are two points on the linear equation

with the slope, $m$, we can find the acute angle, $\theta$, between the equation and the x-axis with $\theta=|\tan^{-1}(m)|$

## slope-intercept form

a linear equation can be in slope-intercept form, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $(0,b)$ is the y-intercept

## point-slope form

a linear equation can be in point-slope form, $y-b=m(x-a)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(a.b)$ is a point on the line

## standard form

a linear equation can be in standard form, $ax+by=c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants
