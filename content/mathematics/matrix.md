in mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, with elements arranged in rows and columns

the size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns it contains
a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called a m-by-n matrix

matrices with a single row are called row vectors, and those with a single column are called column vectors

## notation

A matrix can use square brackets or normal brackets.

$\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&\cdots &a_{1n}\\a_{21}&a_{22}&\cdots &a_{2n}\\\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\a_{m1}&a_{m2}&\cdots &a_{mn}\end{bmatrix}$

## matrix addition

matrix addition is the operation of adding two matrices of the same order

we add the corresponding entries together

## matrix multiplication

matrix multiplication is the operation of multiplying two matrices with a column size matching with a row size, and a row size matching with a column size

## determinant

$\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\c & d\end{bmatrix}$
$\det(\mathbf{A})=\begin{vmatrix}a & b \\c & d\end{vmatrix}$
$\begin{vmatrix}a & b \\c & d\end{vmatrix}=a \cdot d-c \cdot b$
