roughly, a monomial is a math expression that has one term, has variables and involves only the operations addition, multiplication and exponentiation to positive integer powers

a [[polynomial]] is similar to a monomial, without the restriction of having one term

## end behavior

rules about the [[end behavior]] of a monomial of the form $f(x)=ax^n$

if $n$ is even and $a>0$,  $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=\infty$ and  $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty$ 
if $n$ is even and $a>0$,  $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-\infty$ and  $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=-\infty$ 
if $n$ is odd and $a>0$,  $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-\infty$ and  $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty$ 
if $n$ is odd and $a>0$,  $\lim\limits_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=\infty$ and  $\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=-\infty$
