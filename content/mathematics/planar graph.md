in graph theory, a planar graph is a graph where it is possible to make a two dimensional re-representation of the graph where there are no edges crossing

i couldn't find a mathematical definition for this, but logically speaking, since we are limited to two dimensions, the restrictions are as follows:


any graph that contains a subgraph of $K_5$, a [[complete graph]] with 5 vertices, is not planar

any graph that contains a subgraph of $K_{a,b}$ where both $a>2$ and $b>2$ is not planar
