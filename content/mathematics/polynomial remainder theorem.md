in algebra, the polynomial remainder theorem has something to do with the remainder of dividing polynomials by things

if $f(x)$ is divided by $(ax+b)$ then the remainder is equal to $f(\dfrac{-b}{a})$

## example

$f(x)=x^3-12x^2-42$
dividing $f(x)$ by $(x-3)$ gives the quotient $x^2-9x-27$ and the remainder $-123$
therefore, $f(3)=-123$
