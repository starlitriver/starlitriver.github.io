A power function is a function in the form $f(x)=a[b(x-h)]^n+k$

Note: a power function is not an [[exponential function]].

Figure: You must remember the 9 simple power functions of the form $f(x)=x^n$.

A power function is a function in the form $f(x)=a[b(x-h)]^n+k$
- $a$ will make the graph reflect vertically if sign change.
- $b$ will make the graph reflect horizontally if sign change.
- $h$ is horizontal shift.
- $k$ is vertical shift from the origin.








for example, $f(x)=(2(x-1))^{-3}$ can be expressed as $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{[2(x-1)]^3}$

when the exponent of a power function is a fraction we can use algebra to express the function differently
for example, $f(x)=(2(x-1))^\dfrac{1}{3}$ can be expressed as $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{2(x-1)}$





picture $f(a)=a^\dfrac{1}{n}=\dfrac{1}{a^n}$ where $a$ and $n$ are constants
if $n$ is even, $a^\dfrac{1}{n}$ must be positive

if $n$ is odd, $a^\dfrac{1}{n}$ must have the same sign as $a$
