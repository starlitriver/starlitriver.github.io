The quadratic formula can find ==the x-intercepts (roots) of a quadratic.== It is ==$x=\dfrac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$==. 

The discriminant ($\Delta$) of a polynomial determines the number of x-intercepts (roots). It is calculated with $b^2-4ac$.

- $\Delta<0$ means no real solutions, $\Delta=0$ means one solution, $\Delta>0$ means two solutions.
- If $\Delta$ is a perfect square then the solution is rational.
