The numbers in a sequence are called its terms.

The nth term of a sequence is denoted with $t_n$. So the first term is $t_1$.

## sequence

A sequence can be defined in many ways

### recurrence relation

A recurrence relation is a relation that defines a sequence recursively. It means each term is defined using previous terms.

A recurrence relation must have initial conditions - these are specific values of the sequence that are defined directly.


Consider the sequence 3,5,7,9... - The recurrence relation is $t_1=3$, $t_n=t_{n-1}+2$.


Consider the sequence 1,1,2,3,5,8,13... - The recurrence relation is $t_1=1$, $t_2=1$, $t_n=t_{n-2}+t_{n-1}$.

### explicit formula

An explicit formula defines every nth term directly as a function of n.

Consider the sequence 3,5,7,9... - The explicit formula is $t_n=1+2n$.

Consider the sequence 2,5,10,17,26... - The explicit formula is $t_n=n^2+1$.

## series

### arithmetic series

A series is a sum of some terms in a sequence.
