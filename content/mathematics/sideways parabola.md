A sideways parabola is not a function.

Rough sketch for now. Whoop.

It does not pass the vertical line test so is not a function.



General form for sideways parabola is $(y-k)^2=a(x-h)$

- The vertex is $(h,k)$. This means the axis of symmetry is $y=k$
- If a is negative there is a reflection in y axis.
