the surface area to volume ratio of a solid is depicted as the SA:V ratio

start with some 3d solid, like a sphere
as you increase the volume, the volume increases by 3 degrees while the surface area increases by 2 degrees, causing the volume to increase way faster than the surface area.

as an example, let's calculate the SA:V ratio of a cube. let the side length of the cube be $a$, the surface area is calculated with $6a^2$ and the volume is calculated with $a^3$, giving a ratio of $6a^2:a^3$
a ratio less than 1, like in this case, means that an increase or upscale would make the ratio become increasingly smaller

name any [[platonic solid]]
