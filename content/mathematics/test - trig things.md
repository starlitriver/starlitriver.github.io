please remember the common values table.
you better be able to.

for each, simplify the angle into the first quadrant and then evaluate exact answer.
- $\sin(135\degree )$
- $\tan(240\degree )$
- $\cos(330\degree )$
- $\sin(290\degree )$
- $\cos(240\degree )$
- $\sin(120\degree )$
- $\tan(315\degree )$

graph the equations $f(x)=\cos(x)$ and $g(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ for $x\in[0,2\pi]$
- state the x values of the intersections
- solve $\cos(x)>\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$




here are some angle questions to stir up your mind

there is an angle $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$ such that $\tan(\theta )=-\tan(\dfrac{\pi}{3})$. what can be $\theta$?
