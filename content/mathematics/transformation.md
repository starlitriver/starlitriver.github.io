in mathematics, a transformation $T$ is the same as a map or [[function]] over a domain $D$ that takes the elements $X$ to the elements $Y$

in the context of a two dimensional plane, the values of the point $(x,y)$ becomes the point $(x',y')$ where x and y each have a transformation function, $h$ and $j$, such that $h(x)=x'$ and $j(y)=y'$
