In mathematics, the trigonometric functions are functions which relate an angle of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths.

The [[unit circle]] is used to visualize the outputs of the trig functions

In case you are wondering why trig functions are important, we use them a lot in geometric problems and calculus.

## introduction

some easy applications of basic trigonometry is in [[introduction to trigonometry]]

figure: we should be familiar with triangle stuff

We probably know soh cah toa already

sine
$\sin(\theta)=\dfrac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$

cosine
$\cos(\theta)=\dfrac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$

tangent
$\tan(\theta)=\dfrac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$
$\tan(\theta)=\dfrac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$

## notation

trig functions can leave out the brackets where appropriate, like depicting $\sin(x)$ as $\sin x$

a superscript right after the name of a trig function denotes exponentiation, for example, $\sin^2(x)=(\sin(x))^2$
this is different to [[function composition]] where $f^2(x)=(f\circ f)(x)=f(f(x))$

## reciprocal trig functions

sine, cosine and tangent trig functions have their [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]

cosecant
$\csc(\theta)=\dfrac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$

secant
$\sec(\theta)=\dfrac{1}{\cos(\theta)}$

cotangent
$\cot(\theta)=\dfrac{1}{\tan(\theta)}$
$\cot(\theta)=\dfrac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}$

the inverse trig functions are not the same as trig functions

whereas in trig function you input an angle and get a ratio, with inverse trig functions you input a ratio and get an angle

since the trig functions are not one-to-one (see [[relation]]), the inverse trig functions have to restrict their domain

inverse sine is only a segment of the sine function, the $[-\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}]$ segment, and it's the inverse function of this segment
remember the range and how the output of inverse tan always has the same sign as the input

$\sin(x)$
domain: $\mathbb{R}$
range: $[-1,1]$

$\sin^{-1}(x)$
domain: $[-1,1]$
range: $[-\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}]$

the inverse cosine is similar
remember the range and how the output of inverse cosine is always non-negative

$\cos(x)$
domain: $\mathbb{R}$
range: $[-1,1]$

$\cos^{-1}(x)$
domain: $[-1,1]$
range: $[0,\pi]$

the inverse tan has the same range as inverse sine
remember the range and how the output of inverse tan always has the same sign as the input

$\tan(x)$
domain: $\mathbb{R}$
range: $\mathbb{R}$

$\tan^{-1}(x)$
domain: $\mathbb{R}$
range: $[-\dfrac{\pi}{2},\dfrac{\pi}{2}]$
