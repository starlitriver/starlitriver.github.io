1. without using division, show that the first polynomial is divisible by the second


	1. $f(x)=x^3-x^2+x-1$ and $x=1$
	the factor theorem says that when we divide $f$ by $x-1$ the remainder is $f(1)$, which is equal to zero, which proves that it is divisible.
	1. show that $f(x)=2x^3-13x^2+27x-18$ and $2x-3$
	the factor theorem says that when we divide $f$ by $2x-3$ the remainder is $f(\dfrac{3}{2})$, which is equal to zero, which proves that it is divisible.

1. find the value of $k$ if the first polynomial is divisible by the second
	1. $f(x)=x^3-4x^2+x+k$ and $x-3$
	use the factor theorem
	since $x^3-4x^2+x+k$ is divisible by $x-3$, when we divide them the remainder is $f(3)$ which is zero
	since $f(3)=0$, use substitution to find $k=6$


1. $f(x)=x^3-(k+1)x^2-x+30$ and $x+3$
	use the factor theorem
	since $x^3-(k+1)x^2-x+30$ is divisible by $x+3$, when we divide them the remainder is $f(-3)$ which is zero
	since $f(-3)=0$, use substitution to find $k=-\dfrac{1}{3}$

1. factorize the following cubic functions

	1. factorize $f(x)=x^3-4x^2+x+6$
	use the factor theorem
	we can substitute values into $x$ and try to find a x-intercept
	through guessing, we find $f(3)=0$
	according to the factor theorem, $x-3$ is a factor of $f$
	to get the other factors we can divide $f$ by $x-3$ to get $x^2-x-2$
	$f(x)=(x-3)(x-2)(x+1)$


	1. factorize $f(x)=2x^3-3x^2-11x+6$
	use the factor theorem
	we can substitute values into $x$ and try to find a x-intercept
	through guessing, we find $f(-2)=0$
	according to the factor theorem, $x+2$ is a factor of $f$
	to get the other factors we can divide $f$ by $x+2$ to get $2x^2-7x+3$
	$f(x)=(x+2)(2x-1)(x-3)$

1. sketch the graphs of the following equations. state the domain and range.

	1. $3x+4y=12$
	domain is $\mathbb{R}$
	range is $\mathbb{R}$
	substitute $y=0$ to find x-intercept
	substitute $x=0$ to find x-intercept
	

	1. $3x-5y+12=0$
	domain is $\mathbb{R}$
	range is $\mathbb{R}$
	substitute $y=0$ to find x-intercept
	substitute $x=0$ to find x-intercept

1. find the equation of the line in the form of $ax+by+d$ in each of the following

	1. a line that has a slope of $\dfrac{1}{2}$ and passes through $(6,2)$
	we know that $y-2=\dfrac{1}{2}(x-6)$
	$y-2=\dfrac{x}{2}-3$
	$-\dfrac{x}{2}+y=-1$
	1. a line that passes through $(a,2)$ and $(4,-3)$
	we calculate that the slope is $\dfrac{5}{a-4}$
	we know that $y+3=\dfrac{5}{a-4}(x-4)$
	$y+3=\dfrac{5x-4}{a-4}$
	$5x-(a-4)y=8+3a$



1. a line joins the points $(-4,3)$ and $(-2,-1)$


	1. find the exact distance between the points
	$\sqrt{2^2+4^2}$
	$\sqrt{20}$
	$2\sqrt{5}$


	1. find the angle the line makes with the positive direction of the x-axis
	we find the slope
	$m=\dfrac{-4}{2}=-2$
	to find the acute angle the equation makes with the x-axis $\theta$
	$\theta=|\tan^{-1}(-2)|=63.43\degree$
	since the slope is negative, we subtract this from 180 to get answer
	$180-63.34=116.57\degree$


1. find all angles between the lines $y=2x-5$ and $y=-3x+5$ to 1 decimal place
relative to the positive direction of the x-axis, the first equation has an angle of $|\tan^{-1}(2)|=63.43\degree$
relative to the positive direction of the x-axis, the second equation has an angle of $180-|\tan^{-1}(-3)|=108.43\degree$
the difference between the two is $45\degree$
therefore, the angles between the lines are $45\degree$ and $135\degree$


1. find the solutions to the following equations
	1. $x^2+2x-15=0$
	$(x+5)(x-3)=0$

	$(x-2)(x-5)=0$
	$x=2$ or $x=5$
	
	1. $7x^2=2(17x-12)$
	$7x^2-34x+24=0$
	$7x^2-6x-28x+24=0$
	$x(7x-6)+-4(7x-6)=0$
	$(x-4)(7x-6)=0$
	$x=4$ or $x=\dfrac{6}{7}$

find x-intercepts by setting $f(x)=0$
$x^2-3x-2=0$
not able to be factored, use quadratic formula
$x=\dfrac{3\pm\sqrt{9-4\cdot1\cdot-2}}{4\cdot1\cdot-2}$
$x=\dfrac{3\pm\sqrt{17}}{2}$
apply domain restrictions
$x=\dfrac{3-\sqrt{17}}{2}$

	to find the turning point
	$f(x)=x^2+5x+(2.5)^2-(2.5)^2-8$
	$f(x)=(x+2.5)^2-14.25$
	so now we know that the turning point is at $(-2.5,-14.25)$
