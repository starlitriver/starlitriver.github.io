Question. The specific heat capacity of ethanol is 2400 $\text{J}\cdot\text{kg}^{-1}\cdot\text{K}^{-1}$. A sample of ethanol is heated from 22 degrees Celsius to 56 degrees Celsius. If 25kJ of energy was used, calculate the mass of the sample. {We know $Q=mc\Delta T$, and we solve to get 0.31 kg.}

Question. There are two poles in the ocean that are 5 meters apart. 15 waves pass by the poles every minute, and each wave crest takes 4 seconds to move from one pole to the next. Calculate the wavelength of the waves. {We are told that $f=\dfrac{15}{60}$ and $f \lambda=\dfrac{5}{4}$. We find $\lambda$ using $\dfrac{f \lambda}{f}=5$. Wavelength is 5 meters.}

Question. A wave that has a wavelength of 8 meters is traveling at a velocity of 2 m/s. What is the frequency of the wave? {We are told that $\lambda=8$ and $\lambda f=2$. Therefore $f=\dfrac{2}{8}=0.25$}

Question. There are two radio channels, one at 100 MHz and another at 101MHz. Which radio channel has a longer wavelength? {Since the wave velocity $f \lambda$ is dependent on the medium, a greater frequency means a lesser wavelength.}

Question. A cube of ice has mass 80 g and is initially at temperature of -10 degrees Celsius. Calculate the amount of heat energy required to melt the ice cube. Melting point of ice is 0 degrees. Specific heat capacity of ice is 2.11 $\text{kJ}\cdot\text{kg}^{-1}\cdot\text{K}^{-1}$. Latent heat of fusion is 334 $\text{kJ}\cdot\text{kg}^{-1}$. {We know that $Q=mc\Delta T$ and $Q=mL$, so the energy needed to heat it to 0 degrees will be $mc\Delta T$, and the energy needed to melt it will be $mL$. The answer is equal to $mc\Delta T+mL=0.08\cdot2110\cdot10+0.08\cdot334000=28408$ (joules).}
