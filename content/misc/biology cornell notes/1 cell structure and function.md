|**Topic**|**Key Questions**|**Your Summary**|
|**Cell Theory**|Re-state the cell theory|Cells are the basic unit of life.<br><br>All lliving things are mad of cells.<br><br>Cells originate from pre-existing cells.|
|**Organisation** **of living things**|Define Prokaryote|A kingdom of unicellular organisms from prokaryotic cells.|
||Define Eukaryote|A kingdom of unicellular and multicellular organisms from eukaryotic cells.|
||Compare Prokaryotes & Eukaryotes (similarities)|They have a cell membrane and other organelles.|
||Contrast Prokaryotes & Eukaryotes (differences)|Prokaryotes have no membrane bound organelles or nucleus.|
|**Plant cells**|Identify the organelles that are exclusive to plants|Chloroplast, cell wall, large central vacuole.|
||Explain the importance of the cell wall and vacuoles in plant cells.|Cell wall maintains cell structure. The vacuole is big for storing nutrients and waste of the cell.|
|**Organelles** <br><br>**(Define the role of the following organelles)**|nucleus|Contains the DNA and nucleolus.|
||cytoplasm|Is everything inside the cell membrane and outside of the nucleus.|
||cytoskeleton|Protein filaments that give the cell structure.|
||ribosomes|Little producers of protein, for translation.|
||Endoplasmic reticulum|Rough ER is a place for ribosomes to produce proteins, smooth ER can exprtess lipids.|
||Golgi apparatus|Transports things using vesicles.|
||mitochondrion|Use in cellular respiration to produce ATP.|
||Chloroplasts|Photosynthesis, making glucose.|
||Lysosomes|Break down waste things.|
||Cilia & flagella|Movement of cell or functional uses.|
||Centrioles|For cell division.|
||vacuoles|Storage for nutrients and waste.|
|**Plant and Animal cells**|Explain why animal cells to not contain chloroplasts|No need for photosynthesis.|
||Explain why plant cells have mitochondria if they have chloroplasts|Mitochondria breaks glucose into usable energy.|
|**Microscopes**|Describe the work of the light microscope, including the magnification|It shines a light beneath the thing, using lens to magnify.|
||Describe the work of the electron microscope, including the magnification|Electrons are shot towards the thing, to generate computer imagery of seeing things.|
||Contrast the work of the TEM and SEM|TEM has much higher magnification and resolution. SEM creates an image by detecting reflected or knocked-off electrons, In TEM, the electrons that are passing through the sample before they are collected.|
