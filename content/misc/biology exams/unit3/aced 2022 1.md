## Question 3 (8 marks)

A group of students conducted an investigation to observe what happens when yeast is supplied with sucrose in a sealed environment. In their experiment, they used lime water which is typically colourless. When carbon dioxide gas is passed through lime water, the lime water becomes milky due to the formation of white insoluble calcium carbonate. The following method was used:

Method
1.	Place 10g of sucrose solution into a flask.
2.	Add 100ml of lukewarm water and stir until dissolved.
3.	Add 2g of yeast to the sucrose solution and add a layer of paraffin oil to create an anaerobic environment, sealing the conical flask with a rubber stopper containing one hole.
4.	Connect tubing to the rubber stopper and to a separate flask containing lime water. The tubing end that enters the separate flask should be submerged in the limewater.
5.	Record observations of the sucrose and limewater solutions.

## Question 7 (7 marks)

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that produces widespread inflammation in many organs of the human body. It is thought to be triggered by both genetic (in susceptible individuals) and/or environmental factors (such as UV radiation, viruses, medications and oestrogen). The disease causes antigen-antibody complexes to form and deposit in tissues and organs, which produces inflammation. Scientists have found that B cells play a significant role in contributing to this disease with almost all affected individuals showing the presence of specific antibodies, called antinuclear antibodies, in their blood and tissues.

b.	Recently, scientists have produced a monoclonal antibody treatment for SLE that targets the CD20 protein on B cells. CD20 is involved in B cell activation and proliferation. The monoclonal antibody that is produced induces lysis, depleting B cells and, therefore, reducing the symptoms of SLE.

Explain how monoclonal antibodies are produced and how it may be effective in treating SLE.

## Question 8 (8 marks)

Bordetella pertussis is a gram-negative bacterium that causes whooping cough, a severe respiratory infection. It can be deadly in babies under the age of one year old. The pathogen causes disease by releasing toxins that damage cilia, leading to the inflammation of the airways; this causes coughing, a runny nose and, later in the disease progression, vomiting as well as coughing fits that produce high-pitched whooping sounds. In babies, they may not cough at all but, instead, completely stop breathing. Family members, such as parents, grandparents and siblings of the babies, are often the cause of the baby’s infection.

Babies can be vaccinated from the age of six weeks old with five shots, occurring between the ages of six weeks and four years. This provides protection that lasts for approximately 10 years, with a booster shot given as part of the high school vaccination programme in year seven.

A free vaccination programme was introduced to help reduce the spread and the severity of the disease. It targeted pregnant women from 20-31 weeks gestation and their partners and/or primary carers, who are all eligible for free vaccination.

## Question 9 (6 marks)

Australia and Papua New Guinea were once joined by a land bridge with the supercontinent Sahul. Our African ancestors are thought to have migrated to Sahul and spread from east to west perhaps 50,000 years ago. This was revealed by DNA studies that were conducted on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These studies also showed a large amount of genetic variation between the various populations around Australia.

Discovered in 1974, Mungo Man is the oldest human fossil skeleton that has ever been found in Australia and is dated to be 42,000 years old.
Scientists studied his burial site, finding that he was very carefully and ritually laid out and sprinkled with red ochre upon his death.

## Question 10 (5 marks)

Lord Howe Island is a very small island that is located east of mainland New South Wales. It has been geographically isolated for a long time and is home to two species of palm trees – Howea belmoreana and Howea forsteriana – that grow closely to each other but are reproductively isolated. Scientists have genetically analysed the two species to try to determine how they came to be different species. They found that they both originated from one species on the island, with no evidence of geographical isolation between the two species; however, they have different flowering times. Research has shown that H.belmoreana and H.forsteriana prefer different soil types and this has influenced each species’ flowering time. Scientists have suggested this difference in flowering time resulted in their eventual speciation.

a.	Explain how sympatric and allopatric speciation differ. 2 marks










b.	Explain how these two palm trees may have become different species. 3 marks

## Question 11 (7 marks)

Students were placed into groups of three and conducted an investigation to see which concentration of the antibiotic ampicillin would be the most effective in preventing the growth of E. coli, a bacterium. They used serial dilutions of ampicillin up to 2mg/mL and measured the zone of inhibition radius (ZOI - the area in which the bacteria did not grow) in millimetres after incubating the bacteria for 10 hours. The ZOI was measured with a ruler. A diagram demonstrating this information is shown below.

Each student took turns to perform the method, with each student responsible for carrying out only one of the three trials. The students were provided with the method below and recorded their results in the table as shown.

Method:
1.	Use a Bunsen burner to create a sterile environment.
2.	Label each agar plate with the different ampicillin concentrations.
3.	Use a sterile swab to transfer bacteria from the broth to the agar and rotate the plate as the bacteria are spread.
4.	Use sterile forceps to dip a paper disc into the corresponding ampicillin concentration and place this onto the agar plate.
5.	Seal the lid of the plate with tape.
6.	Repeat steps one to five for each ampicillin concentration.
7.	Incubate at 35oC for 10 hours.
8.	Using a ruler, measure the ZOI radius (mm) for each concentration of ampicillin.

a.	Identify the dependent and independent variables in this experiment. 2 marks




b.	Explain why the experiment was repeated. 1 mark






c.	Identify which concentration of ampicillin has the most precise data. Justify your answer.






1








d.	After the experiment, one of the students commented that it might be a good idea to infect humans with E.coli and then try different concentrations of the antibiotic ampicillin to determine which is most effective. However, a second student remarked that this may breach the ethical principle of non-maleficence.

Outline whether or not you think the second student is correct and justify your response.
