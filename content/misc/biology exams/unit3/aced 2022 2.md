## Question 1 (12 marks)

Scientists in Melbourne have been experimenting using CRISPR in mice to inactivate a mutated version of the GG1 gene that they believe may be disease-causing in humans and mammals. In mice, the GG1 gene is 2380 base pairs (bp) long. The mutated variation known as GG1-B is 2930 bp long.

Scientists screened baby mice for the GG1-B variant using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to target and amplify the gene.

The basis of the ‘Out of Africa’ model is that Homo sapiens evolved first in Africa and then spread around the world between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, superseding all other hominin species.

Modern humans had reached Asia approximately 70,000 years ago before moving down through South-east Asia and into Australia approximately 50,000 years ago. Homo sapiens, however, were not the first hominins to inhabit this region; Homo erectus had already been in Asia for at least 1.5 million years.

Humans have two sets of chromosomes (i.e., humans are diploid). It is common for plants to have more than two sets of chromosomes; this can be advantageous, especially to crop plants, due to increased heterozygosity and as this can protect against the effects of deleterious mutations. It also, however, often results in reduced fertility due to meiotic errors, allowing for the production of seedless varieties.
