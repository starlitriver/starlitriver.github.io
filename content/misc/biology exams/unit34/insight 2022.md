## Question 4 (7 marks)

During a period of 20 years the elephant population of Gorongosa in Mozambique decreased from over 2500 to approximately 200. The decrease in population was largely due to the actions of poachers who killed elephants for their ivory tusks. Over the same period of time, the percentage of tuskless female elephants increased from 18% to 38%. The fact that no tuskless males had been observed was investigated.
The genomes of 18 female elephants, 7 with tusks and 11 without tusks, were sequenced and it was identified that two genes were responsible for helping to build tusks. One of these is the AMELX gene, which is located on the X chromosome. A mutation was found that causes tusklessness in females, but which is lethal to males. It was found that all tuskless females had one copy of the mutation, so that when a female reproduced, her daughters would have a 50% chance of being tuskless. The male offspring would have a 50% chance of having tusks and a 50% chance of dying before birth.
a.	Identify the process that affected the incidence of tusklessness in female elephants.

## Question 5 (5 marks)

Several species of spruce tree, such as the balsam fir, white spruce and red spruce, are grown for their timber. All are vulnerable to the spruce budworm, a parasite that feeds on their leaves, killing them within five years of infestation.

Source: Michigan Department of Natural Resources
However, it has been established that spruce trees have varying degrees of resistance to the budworm, with white spruce trees having the greatest resistance.
a.	Outline how a selective breeding program could be carried out to produce populations of white spruce tree that are highly resistant to the budworm.
3 marks














It has been established that the source of the resistance in white spruce is a gene that codes for the enzyme β-glucosidase. This enzyme is responsible for catalysing the reactions in which sugars are broken down into two compounds, pungenol and piceol, both of which have a toxic effect on the budworm.
Scientists employed by the timber industry have proposed transfecting the gene for
β-glucosidase production into balsam fir and red spruce, resulting in the production of transgenic plants with a higher degree of resistance to the budworm.
b.	Identify another benefit of producing these transgenic spruce trees.

c.	Identify an example of a physical barrier that the spruce trees could have to protect themselves from infestation by the budworm.

## Question 6 (8 marks)

The production of synthetic human growth hormone (HGH) is accomplished using a strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria as a host. A laboratory plasmid that already contained two antibiotic resistance genes – one for tetracycline and one for ampicillin – was further modified by having the gene for HGH inserted. Copies of the vector plasmid produced were then exposed to the bacteria, and those that transformed were subsequently used to
produce HGH.
a.	Draw a flow chart identifying at least three stages in the production of the vector plasmid.
3 marks

































b.	Identify a technique that could be used to separate vector plasmids from plasmids that did not contain the HGH gene.

The E. coli that took up the vector plasmid are referred to as being transformed.

d.	Identify a procedure that could be carried out to isolate the transformed bacteria. How might this procedure enable the transformed bacteria to be identified?

## Question 7 (6 marks)

Three populations of closely related small birds live separately on the three islands represented in the diagram below. Population A lives on Island A, Population B on Island B and Population C on Island C.
The birds are all a similar size and have a similar diet. However, their feathers are different colours. Population A has a crest, which is lacking in Populations B and C. Mating between Populations B and C produces viable offspring but even artificial insemination of Population A with sperm from Populations B or C does not result in living viable offspring.

1 mark










b.	Identify two conclusions that can be made about the degree of genetic similarity between the three populations.


2 marks










c.	Identify and explain the mechanism whereby Population A has become a separate species.

On 25 June 2021, scientists announced that a skull discovered in China represented a new species of hominin, subsequently named Homo longi. The skull has been described as having ‘typical archaic human features’.
The skull was dated as being 146 000 years old, meaning H. longi lived at the same time as Homo sapiens. As a result of genetic sequencing, it has been determined that H. longi represents an additional lineage of modern hominin. This species shares a more recent common ancestor with H. sapiens than Homo neanderthalensis, and it has been suggested that
H. longi should replace H. neanderthalensis as the closest relative of H. sapiens.
a.	Identify an absolute dating technique that could have been used to determine the age of this fossil.
1 mark

What is CRISPR, the gene editing technology that won the Chemistry Nobel prize?
CRISPR technology is adapted from a system that is naturally present in bacteria and other unicellular organisms known as archaea.
This natural system gives bacteria a form of acquired immunity. It protects them from foreign genetic elements (such as invading viruses) and lets them ‘remember’ these in case they reappear.
…
In 1987, Japanese molecular biologist Yoshizumi Ishino and his colleagues were the first to notice, in E. coli bacteria, unusual clusters of repeated DNA sequences interrupted by short sequences. Spanish molecular biologist Francisco Mojica and colleagues later showed similar structures were present in other organisms and proposed to call them CRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. In 2005, Mojica and other groups reported the short sequences (or ‘spacers’) interrupting the repeats were derived from other DNA belonging to viruses.
Evolutionary biologists … eventually proposed CRISPR and the associated Cas9 genes were acting as the immune mechanism.
…
The CRISPR-associated genes, Cas9, encode a protein that ‘cuts’ DNA. This is the active part of the defence against viruses, as it destroys the invading DNA.
In 2012, [Emmanuelle] Charpentier and [Jennifer] Doudna showed the spacers acted as markers that guided where Cas9 would make a cut in the DNA. They also showed an artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence in a lab setting.
This was a ground-breaking discovery which opened the door for CRISPR’s wider applications in research.
…
Humans have altered the genomes of species for thousands of years. Initially, this was through approaches such as selective breeding.
However, genetic engineering – the direct manipulation of DNA by humans outside of breeding and mutations – has only existed since the 1970s.
CRISPR-based systems fundamentally changed this field, as they allow for genomes to be edited in living organisms cheaply, with ease and with extreme precision.
CRISPR … has great potential in food production. It can be used to improve crop quality, yield, disease resistance and herbicide resistance. Used on livestock, it can lead to better disease resistance, increased animal welfare and improved productive traits – that is, animals producing more meat, milk or high-quality wool.
A number of challenges to the technology remain, however. Some are technical, such as the risk of off-target modifications.

## Question 10 (13 marks)

Catalase is an enzyme that catalyses the reaction in which hydrogen peroxide is broken down into oxygen and water. This enzyme is found in many plant and animal cells.
A student carried out an experiment regarding the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to determine the effect that changing temperature had on the rate of the reaction. The student hypothesised that the reaction rate would increase until the temperature reached 37 °C and would then decrease.
The experiment was carried out by placing cylinders of potato into solutions containing hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen produced during the reaction caused a foam to form on top of the solution. The height of the foam was measured and used to determine the rate of the reaction.
Five test tubes were prepared, each containing 15 mL of the same hydrogen peroxide solution. Five water baths were also prepared at different temperatures: 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C and 50 °C.
One of each test tube was placed into each water bath for a period of two minutes. During this time, a potato cylinder was cut into five equal pieces.
One piece of potato was placed into each test tube. After one minute, the height of the foam in each test tube was recorded.
