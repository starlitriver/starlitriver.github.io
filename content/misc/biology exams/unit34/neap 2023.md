Use the following information to answer Questions 8–10.
Short tandem repeats (STRs) are regularly used to determine genetic uniqueness. For a criminal case involving theft, a biotechnologist used two STRs for 10 male suspects. The following diagram represents the two STRs (site 1 and site 2) that are located on the Y chromosome of three of the suspects. Each repeat is a sequence of four nucleotides (AGAT).

![[Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 6.17.47 pm.jpg]]

Each suspect’s DNA was extracted from a saliva sample, then purified and amplified. Small volumes were added into wells prior to gel electrophoresis. The results of the first run were surprising and are shown below.
![[Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 6.18.06 pm.jpg]]
The biotechnologist then realised their error and repeated the gel electrophoresis with a small change in their methodology. The subsequent results are shown below.

![[Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 6.18.10 pm.jpg]]

## Question 8

The results of the first gel electrophoresis were probably due to the
A.	systematic error of not switching on the power source for the gel electrophoresis tank.
B.	random error of connecting the electrodes the wrong way around.
C.	random error of adding different volumes of DNA samples to each well prior to the run.
D.	systematic error of piercing a hole in the wells when adding the DNA.

## Question 9

Which of the following matches the gel electrophoresis lanes to the suspects?

|       |       |       |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | **2** | **3** |

| Jared | Adam  | Chris |
| Chris | Adam  | Jared |
| Jared | Chris | Adam  |

A.	Adam	Chris	Jared
B.	Jared	Adam	Chris
C.	Chris	Adam	Jared
D.	Jared	Chris	Adam

## Question 10

The criminal case involved theft and there was blood residue found on the stolen items. The STRs showed that only one of the 10 suspects had a profile that matched the profile from the blood residue. The evidence was thrown out of court and the individual was free to go due to the bioethical concept of justice.
The most likely reason for this is that
A.	one blood sample found at a crime scene is not enough to extract sufficient concentrations of DNA.
B.	more STRs should have been analysed because there may be many people other than the suspect that have the same profile.
C.	the gel needed a greater voltage applied to obtain better resolution of the bands present for each suspect.

Purified Rubisco was exposed to a variety of conditions to determine its optimal functioning. In the investigation, samples of purified Rubisco were mixed into 0.5 mL of solutions containing equal concentrations of the substrates carbon dioxide and ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Each solution was incubated at a different temperature. After a set incubation period, the amount of phosphoglycerate (PGA) produced by each reaction was measured using the phosphoglycerate fluorescence test. In this test, a greater concentration of PGA produces a higher number of relative fluorescence units (RFU). Each reaction was repeated four times, and the results are shown in the following table.

Use the following information to answer Questions 25–27.
Tiara is a toddler who has started to eat a wide variety of foods. One day, she developed a swollen tongue and red rashes on her skin after consuming peanut and chocolate ice-cream. Tiara’s parents arranged for Tiara to undergo an allergy test called a skin prick test. The test involved a doctor using a lancet to insert a small amount of suspected allergens into areas of Tiara’s skin and observing whether a reaction (in the form of a red rash) occurred. Histamine – which is a chemical that the body releases during an allergic reaction, causing a red rash and sometimes anaphylaxis – was tested first, followed by seven allergens; these were tested on Tiara’s forearm. The following diagram shows the result of Tiara’s skin prick test.
The black circles indicate no reaction, and the white circles indicate a reaction. The size of each white circle indicates the degree of inflammation.

Met - Leu - Ala - Met

a.	Name the process that assembles the amino acids in the order shown above and identify
the location where this process occurs. 2 marks
Process   Location  
The genome carries a universal code, and the section coding for the polypeptide sequence shown above is a small part of it.
b.	i. Define what is meant by a universal code. 1 mark




ii. Would it be true to say that both the polypeptide sequence shown above and the codons involved in the sequence would be the same in all individuals? Explain

synthesised and describe their roles. 2 marks

## Question 2 (9 marks)

Transthyretin amyloidosis is a rare protein disorder that affects around 50 000 people worldwide. It is caused by changes in the transthyretin (TTR) gene, which produces the TTR protein. The condition causes a build-up or clumps of protein to form in the body’s organs and tissues and interfere with the heart and nerves.
A drug called Onpattro that is designed to disable the TTR gene to treat transthyretin amyloidosis was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2018 after clinical trials. In the trials, the drug reduced the symptoms of transthyretin amyloidosis by 80%. However, the drug must be taken regularly to keep TTR levels down and does not always halt disease progression.
a.	State one ethical approach that the scientists conducting the clinical trials could have
adopted and explain how this would have informed their treatment of patients in the trials. 3 marks











CRISPR-Cas9 has also been hailed as a revolutionary way to treat diseases such as transthyretin amyloidosis. To be used as a treatment, the CRISPR–Cas9 complex must be packaged in a way that shields it from degradation and delivered to the site in the body where it is needed.
b.	Identify and outline the functions of the two main components of the CRISPR-Cas9
complex. 4 marks








c.	The genome-editing company Intellia conducted clinical trials in 2021 to test a CRISPR-Cas9 treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis. The trials found that symptoms in all patients were reduced by up to 96%.
Explain how the ethical concept of beneficence could be applied when determining whether to use Intellia’s CRISPR-Cas9 treatment or Onpattro to treat transthyretin
amyloidosis. 2 marks

## Question 3 (8 marks)

The production of genetically modified insulin involves the creation of two recombinant plasmids, each one containing the sequence for one of the two polypeptides (insulin A and insulin B) required to produce the functional insulin protein. One of the plasmids is spliced with an ampicillin resistance gene (amp) and
a -galactosidase gene (with a EcoRI restriction enzyme/endonuclease binding site next to it). When active, the -galactosidase gene produces galactosidase, which converts X-gal from a colourless compound to a
blue compound. The following diagram shows the insulin A gene being inserted into this plasmid. The process for the insulin B gene insertion is the same.


![[Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 6.27.47 pm.jpg]]

## Question 6 (8 marks)

The human body’s ability to distinguish between self- and non-self antigens is an important first step in any immune response. When the body responds to viral diseases such as COVID-19, most of the body’s cells are spared from destruction by the immune system but some are targeted for destruction with laser-like precision.
a.	Describe how the immune system of a person who has recently contracted COVID-19 would distinguish between cells that need to be destroyed and cells that do not need
to be destroyed. 2 marks







The immune system consists of many different types of cells, each playing an important role in immunological health.
b.	In the table below, identify whether each immune cell is part of the innate immune system,

|                      |                                          |                   |

## Question 7 (8 marks)

In 2021, 8.4 million people around the world had type 1 diabetes. A modelling study has predicted that by 2040, this number may rise to 17.4 million. Type 1 diabetes causes the immune system to see insulin-secreting -cells in the pancreas as foreign and, over time, these cells are destroyed.
a.	What type of immune disorder would type 1 diabetes be categorised as? 1 mark

-cell destruction occurs when specific cytotoxic T cells are formed against markers on the surface of the cells.
b.	What type of immune response involves T cells? 1 mark

There are different types of T cells involved in immunity. This is significant for targeted immunotherapy to treat type 1 diabetes. Some T cells behave as helper cells, and some T cells behave as cytotoxic cells.
c.	Outline the function of each of the following.
i.	helper T cell 1 mark




ii.	cytotoxic T cell 1 mark




d.	In 2022, the drug teplizumab was approved for use in the USA as an immunotherapy treatment for diabetes. Teplizumab is a modified monoclonal antibody that binds to the T lymphocytes that attack the insulin-producing -cells in type 1 diabetes patients.
The drug specifically attaches to a molecule called CD3, inhibiting the T cells’ ability to attack the -cells.
Explain how teplizumab can be produced. 4 marks

## Question 8 (8 marks)

The TBX3 gene controls leg length in many animals, including horses. A study using many modern horses found a direct correlation between the lengths of the horses’ legs and the amount of TBX3 gene activation, which explains how leg length in ancestral horses may have evolved. The following diagram shows the bones of the front lower legs of three ancestral horses and the modern horse. A scale is provided.

![[Screenshot 2025-01-31 at 6.29.42 pm.jpg]]

a.	In terms of mutations in the TBX3 gene, describe how the long legs of Equus evolved
from the short legs of Hyracotherium. 4 marks








As shown in the diagram on page 26, the middle digit in Hyracotherium became bigger over time, forming a single hoof in Equus. The digits on either side did not become bigger. Only remnants of them remain
in Equus; an example is shaded in the diagram.
b.	i. State the term that describes the remnant digits that remain in Equus. 1 mark


ii. Considering the ancestral horse species from 50 mya to 15 mya, why is it less appropriate to suggest that the remnant digits have been selected against rather
than suggesting that the middle digit has been selected for? 1 mark






c.	Some sceptics suggest there is not enough evidence available to make conclusions relating to the evolution of the horse. They argue that too few fossils have been found to make conclusions.
Describe two pieces of evidence that would need to be present in a 25-million-year-old fossil of a previously undiscovered ancestral horse that would support the evolution
of Equus from Hyracotherium. 2 marks

## Question 9 (8 marks)

Modern humans arrived in Indonesia, which is located in Southeast Asia, about 60 000 years ago.
The distant ancestor of modern humans Homo erectus migrated out of Africa about 2 million years ago, travelled to Indonesia and lived there until about 100 000 years ago, long after they had gone extinct elsewhere in the world. When sea levels rose, Homo erectus became isolated on some of the Indonesian islands, including Java. Several Homo erectus fossils have been found in Java along with a range of tools that have been dated to about 100 000 years old.
a.	Define the term hominin. 1 mark




b.	Identify and outline the method of dating fossils that are expected to be 100 000 years old. 2 marks







When modern humans arrived in Indonesia, Homo erectus had probably gone extinct because rising sea levels changed the environment to an extent that was detrimental to their survival. Researchers also argue that Homo erectus splintered into the species Homo floresiensis and Homo luzonensis, in addition to other species located throughout Southeast Asia, approximately 100 000 years ago. Fossils of Homo floresiensis were found on the Indonesian island of Flores and dated to exist between 100 000 and 60 000 years ago. Fossils of Homo luzonensis were found on the island of Luzon in the Philippines and dated to exist between 70 000 and 50 000 years ago.
c.	In the space below, draw a scaled phylogram for the last 500 000 years of the Homo erectus
branch of the evolutionary tree in Southeast Asia. Include both Homo floresiensis and Homo luzonensis. 3 marks



d.	During its migration to Java, Homo erectus may have interbred at some point with the Denisovans. The Denisovans may have also interbred with modern humans in Indonesia and New Guinea as recently as 30 000 years ago. Much of the Denisovan genome has been sequenced, but the Homo erectus genome has not.
Based on the information provided, describe the evidence of this interbreeding that would
be present in the modern Southeast Asian human genome. 2 marks

## Question 10 (10 marks)

Yeast is a single-celled, eukaryotic heterotroph that is used extensively in the food and alcohol industries. It is also used as an experimental model for a variety of other purposes. An investigation was conducted by a diet and nutrition organisation in Australia to study the effect of different types of sugar and sugar substitutes on cellular respiration and heat production in yeast. The following method was used.
1.	Make four 10% yeast solutions by mixing 5 g of dried yeast with 50 ml of fresh tap water in a large, conical flask.
2.	Make four 2% sugar solutions by mixing each sugar/sugar substitute (glucose, low-calorie sweetener, saccharin and stevia) with 50 ml of fresh tap water.
3.	Add each sugar solution to a 10% yeast solution in the conical flask, making a 100 ml mixture.
4.	Place a thermometer into each sugar–yeast solution and record the initial temperature.
5.	Measure the temperature change from the initial temperature every 30 minutes for a 4-hour period. The experiment was repeated three times.
a.	State the hypothesis of the experiment. 1 mark




b.	Identify one variable that should have been controlled in the experiment and outline how
it may have influenced the reliability of the data collected. 2 marks








c.	A Biology student who was reading about the investigation stated that because the experiment was repeated and reproduced, the reliability of the data collected was increased.
Determine whether the student’s statement is correct. Justify your response. 2 marks






Some of the data collected during the experment is recorded in the following table.
