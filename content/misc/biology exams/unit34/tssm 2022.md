## Question 6

In Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique, a previously rare genetic condition has become more common,asivorypoachingusedtofinanceacivilwarpushedthe elephant speciestothebrinkofextinction. Before the war, about 18.5% of female elephants were naturally tuskless. However, that figure has risen to 33% among elephants born since the early 1990s. Some 90% of Mozambique's elephant population was slaughtered by fighters on both sides of the civil war that lasted from 1977 to 1992.

Asineye colour and blood type in humans, genes are responsible for whether elephants inherit tusks from their parents. Elephants without tusks were left alone by hunters, leading to an increased likelihood theywould breed and pass on the tuskless trait to their offspring.

Researchers have long suspected that the trait, only seen in females, was linked to the sex of the elephant. After the genomes of tusked and tuskless elephants were sequenced, analysis revealed that the trend was linked to a mutation on the X chromosome that was fatal to males, which did not develop properly in the womb, and dominant in females.

The study has revealed that tusked and tuskless animals eat different plants. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-59008037

1. A local parliamentarian suggested that those who work in high risk industries, such as the medical field, should be routinely tested for HIV to minimise potential outbreaks and spread, as HIV has no cure.
