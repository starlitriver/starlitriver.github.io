## Question 5

Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by bacteria in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
lato group. Ticks are parasitic arachnids that feed on the blood of other animals. Insect repellents are effective preventions against ticks.

![[Image from 2023-tssm-units-3-4, page 19.png|340]]

Initially, a person infected with Lyme disease will show a pink or red rash that starts as a small red spot, this then gradually spreads in a much larger circle with a characteristic bulls-eye appearance called erythema migrans, normally appearing between 3 and 32 days after being bitten by an infected tick.
Not everyone with Lyme disease gets the rash. There may also be fever, headaches and tiredness.

If left untreated, the Lyme disease infection can spread through the bloodstream and can cause infection in the brain and membranes surrounding the brain, and infection in or around the heart. The disease can also cause inflammation of joints and cause joint pain and long-term neurological symptoms.

## Question 7

Debunking the myth that Aboriginal stories are just myths: the Yamuti and the megafauna Diprotodon
Jacinta Koolmatrie is an Adnyamathanha and Ngarrindjeri person who works in the South Australian museum sector.
https://australian.museum/learn/first-nations/yamuti/

Since the beginning of time my ancestors have been telling stories. These stories, derived from the land, waters and skies. We express our stories using our voice and through our actions. They are told at night, when the fire crackles and the stars are bright. They are told through the marking of the walls using sacred pigments the land has provided for us. They are the foundations of our songs and dances. Our language itself would not exist without these stories.

As a young Adnyamathanha kid, I was told the story about the Yamuti. The Yamuti was a very large and scary animal that specifically looked to steal little kids. This story was not told in a way that placed it in the past, the Yamuti existed in real time. We were always told that if we ever saw the Yamuti we had to run to the nearest tree and climb high, because the Yamuti had one flaw, the Yamuti could not look up. Despite us little kids having this one advantage, the thought of being taken by the Yamuti was scary enough to make us never want to leave our mothers side, especially if we were outside in the dark.

One of the striking descriptions of the Yamuti was that he is very big. Bigger than us kids especially. But this isn’t a unique description, many of the animals in our stories are big.

Thousands of years ago megafauna were abundant on this land. One animal in particular was the Diprotodon, the largest marsupial to have existed. The Diprotodon was incredibly large and thought to have been a browser, eating plants like shrubs. However, it’s mostly believed to have been a harmless animal.

Thinking more about the Diprotodon’s physical description, it is oddly similar to that of the Yamuti. Interestingly, I was even told that our understanding that a Yamuti could not look up, did show some potential of being present on a Diprotodon’s skeleton. Of course, our understanding of the behaviour of a Yamuti does not really line up with the Diprotodon’s behaviour. But maybe it gives some insight into a characteristic that Palaeontologists aren’t yet aware of, or even something they may never be aware of.

If the Yamuti and the Diprotodon are the same animal, this shows an incredible depth of knowledge that has flowed through thousands of Adnyamathanha generations. In our region the most recent dating of bones is no younger than 40,000 years!

Whether or not you believe the Diprotodon is the Yamuti, our stories are derived from the truth. Something happened over 40,000 years ago that made my ancestors tell a story to protect their children. This relates to all of our stories. They simply weren’t told to pass the time, these stories were created to help us live on this land. The most amazing thing about all of this is that despite animals becoming extinct, lands changing, and our stories being reframed as myths, they have prospered right through to today.



1. Identify how Indigenous stories of the Yamuti suggest that it may be one of the ancient marsupials Diprotodon, which was prevalent in the Australian landscape 40,000 years ago. ]]2
1. How do Indigenous stories, communicated as spoken language, art, dance and song, demonstrate connection to Country and Place. ]]2
1. Identify and describe the process by which remains, such as those of Diprotodon, could be dated as being 40,000 years old. ]]3
1. State two features of the skull that could be used to differentiate a hominoid from a hominin. ]]2

## Question 8

As part of the extended practical investigation task, a group of students collected a data set for analysis.
They wanted to investigate effect of different wavelengths of light on the rate of photosynthesis. They counted the number of spinach leaf discs that rose to the top of a solution each minute, after being exposed to different wavelengths of light. The rising of the spinach leaves indicated that photosynthesis was occurring as oxygen bubbles were being produced as an output of this reaction.
Some of their data is shown below. The data is cumulative.

| Minutes | Number of spinach leaves that rose to the sureface | Number of spinach leaves that rose to the sureface | Number of spinach leaves that rose to the sureface |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
