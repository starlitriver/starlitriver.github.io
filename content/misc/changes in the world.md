Yet since Durov’s arrest, Telegram has introduced a series of subtle changes. In late August, the company’s FAQ page read: “To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.” Now the phrase “user data” has been replaced with “user messages.” Telegram did not reply to WIRED’s request for comment asking what exactly this change means.

Then, early in September, Telegram quietly made it possible for users to report illegal content in private and group chats for moderators to review. Later that same month, Durov also announced Telegram had changed its terms of service to prevent the app’s abuse by criminals and would share user locations in response to legal requests. “We’ve made it clear that the IP addresses and phone numbers of those who violate our rules can be disclosed to relevant authorities,” he said at the time.
