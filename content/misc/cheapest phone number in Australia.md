Cheapest phone number in Australia.

A phone number holder has to be at least 16 years old. Unfortunately.

Provider: https://aldimobile.com.au.

- Purchase a "$5 starter pack" at store.
- Create ALDImobile account, requires one piece of personal ID.
- Let X equal to "PAYG days remaining", which decreases by 1 each day.
- Let "code green" be the state where your service is good.
- Let "code yellow" be the state where your service is expired, meaning you can receive text messages and phone calls but you can't make them.
- Let "code red" be the state where your phone number is useless.
- Important note: your account is code green until X=0, then code yellow until X=-90, then code red.
- Activate "$5 starter pack". Congratulations, you have a phone number! Set X=60.
- You can "recharge PAYG15" (it costs 15 dollars and just google it), to make X=365.

That's all the info you need for keeping your phone number!
