animal ethics is a heated moral debate

speciesism is a form of prejudice
this is similar to racism as people prioritize their own species whilst exploiting or harming other species

there is no moral justification or specific reason for prioritizing the interests of one species over the interests of another - including that of our own

one's species is not a morally relevant characteristic because it is no more significant than being born in another place
being human is not a significant factor as to whether we care about the interests and feelings of beings

the potential for pleasure and pain should be the considered factor that we must accept for everyone, including all animals
any being that has an interest in avoiding suffering deserves to have their interest taken into account when considering morality
