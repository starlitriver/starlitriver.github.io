awareness is a [[perception]] or [[knowledge]]

awareness is similar to [[consciousness]], but one can be aware of something without being conscious.
the definitions of awareness and consciousness are quite similar
it's weird but it makes sense. you may be aware of many things, but some things that you are aware of do not make it into your consciousness
