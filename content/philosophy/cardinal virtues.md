The cardinal virtues are the four [[virtue|virtues]] in classical philosophy

## prudence

Prudence is the ability to discern the appropriate course of action to be taken in a situation at the appropriate time

Justice is how individuals are to be treated in a manner that is equitable and fair.

We always want there to be justice. So we want "a fair and just world"

## fortitude
