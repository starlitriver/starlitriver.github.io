coherentism is a theory of epistemic justification

it implies that for a belief to be justified, it must belong to a coherent system of beliefs.

for a system of beliefs to be coherent, the beliefs that make up that system must align and fit in with another and reflect the context of the world around us.

advantages of coherentism
- it aligns knowledge and beliefs with their place in the world
- it applied out own beliefs and ideas to further knowledge
- it allows for different methods

disadvantages of coherentism
- it could be seem as a form of circular reasoning - it is not actually explaining the
concept with evidence. by saying it is justified because other beliefs line up with it,
you could fall into justifying a claim with a claim
- we aren't providing any reasoning beyond merely repeating what we are trying to prove
