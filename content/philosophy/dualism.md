dualism means that some things can be physical while others can be virtual 

it argues that the mind and body must be separate, with the mind as a being distinct from the brain.
in this view, the mind is seen as ethereal and spiritual in nature and is unable to be seen or touched.
this is used to easily explain things like the possibility of life after death or near death experiences

### property dualism

1 substance but 2 distinct properties which divide mind and body.
mental properties are physical properties, mind and body are distinguished.

### cartesian or substance dualism

2 fundamentally different substances in the universe, immaterial, and material.
the immaterial mind and physical body work together to create day to day experiences.
