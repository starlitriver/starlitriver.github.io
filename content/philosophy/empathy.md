empathy allows us to feel things that others feel

you feel stuff, yes?
well, an uncountable number of people feel stuff too.
why don't you be curious and feel what they feel?

see, empathy is important.
it's like magic.

it's perhaps the sole reason for morality...
empathy makes us feel that pain as if it were our own.
