epistemology is an umbrella term used to describe the study of philosophical problems underlying theories of [[knowledge]]

epistemology attempts to answer important questions such as:

- **is knowledge possible or is it just belief?**
- **are there things we cannot doubt?**
- **how much evidence is needed for us to be certain?**
- **can we trust our senses?**
