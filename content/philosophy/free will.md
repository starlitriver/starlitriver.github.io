free will: the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion.

determinism - the doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by what causes regarded as external to the will. some philosophers think that this means that one has no free will and therefore cannot be responsible for their actions.

hard determinism is hard to refute - although agents like us can form thoughts to do causes out of nothingness, but our minds are ultimately physical and therefore is already determined by the physics
