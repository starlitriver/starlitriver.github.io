i saw an article that is curious and thinks about friendships [^areyoumyfriend]


okay, i admit it. i really worry about making friends
that is, intentionally making friends. i think that most of us 

why, close friendships usually happen naturally, yes? but with good intentions, we can do things and optimize friendships


it's true that most friendships are only on the surface. the saying "you only know a tiny bit everyone else" is really applicable here


and we never just fully intend to make close friends. that may feel silly
"go out of your way to form emotional connections" isn't part of our goals[^intentionallymakingclosefriends]
