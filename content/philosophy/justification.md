to justify something is really hard.

we most justify a belief by appealing to another, which then requires further justification

this is called the infinite regress problem - the chain of justification stretches back infinitely.

to have one justified belief, we need to have infinite beliefs backing it up
this is the idea that nothing can be proven and you can never have knowledge.

these are the theories of justification
- [[foundationalism]]
- [[coherentism]]
- [[reliabilism]]
