knowledge is the awareness / perception / understanding of something

there are [[types of knowledge]]
for example, the knowledge of how to do things and the knowledge of something

it is required to form [[arguments]]

but what does it mean to have knowledge of something?

[[plato's theory of knowledge]] states that you need to believe something, have justification / evidence to support your belief.
however, it is not a justified theory, and making it complete is harder than expected

the hardest part of knowledge is to [[justification|justify]] it
