morality is the differentiation of intentions, decisions and actions that are proper or improper

it is about right and wrong - but can there be a universal agreement of what is right or wrong?

the study of morality is [[ethics]]

## how did moral instincts come to be?

how we judge something to be right or wrong is the purpose of morality.
how and when can something be called good or bad?
how do we know is something is moral or not - is it something that causes joy?

### evolutionary

evolutionary theories argue that moral instincts are evolved through natural selection, just like other biological traits, that is, we are biologically wired to react in a certain way. the idea of reciprocal altruism, that is, i'll scratch your back and you scratch mine, is biological as well
- how do evolutionary theorists explain the origins of moral instincts and behaviors? what are some examples of moral instincts that might have evolved?
evolutionary theorists say the origins of moral instincts are evolved just like other biological traits, through natural selection. some moral instincts that might have evolved are sense of community for safety in numbers, or group cooperation as a means of collective survival

### cultural

cultural relativism is part of what shapes our moral judgments
moral beliefs are shaped by your cultural context
it varies from culture to culture, and some things are wrong in different countries because of traditions and cultures, therefore making something weird or wrong in that culture
- what are the key arguments of cultural relativism in explaining the diversity of moral values across different cultures? how does this theory challenge the notion of universal moral principles?
cultural relativism shows that depending on the context of culture and community, some things may or may not be regarded as morally wrong. this challenges the notion of universal moral principles because this shows that moral principles can alter according to context and perspective

### rational

rationalism is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the role of reason in the understanding of the world and in making decisions
in morality, rationalism holds that moral truths can be discovered through reason alone, without the need for tradition
according to rationalism, moral principles are not arbitrary or subjective, but based on objective facts about the world
like, if everyone in the world lied all of the time, would anyone want to live in the world?
using logic, there are no intrinsic rights or wrongs, but rather a through and just evaluation of the 
it gives you the idea that the circumstances can all be logically argued to form the conclusion whether an action is moral or not
- according to rationalism, how can reason and rational thinking help us determine moral truths? can moral principles be derived solely through logical inquiry?
moral principles can be derived solely through logical inquiry because it is possible to define many moral principles through the use of logic alone
