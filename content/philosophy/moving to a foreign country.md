lets think about the things that happen if you were to move to a foreign land

just suppose that you brought your stuff and had to settle down in a new country. preferably somewhere you're very unfamiliar with

things are new and exciting, you have to carefully plan out all your actions in order to settle here well, and your plan is set in motion

but soon, you established your routines without realizing it, and each day would be just a [[normal day]]
