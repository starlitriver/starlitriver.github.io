yes, normal day.

but what about it? well, i was just thinking about the definition of a normal day, why normal days happen, characteristics of normal days and the impact of these days in our lives

[this article](https://moretothat.com/travel-is-no-cure-for-the-mind) is a nice illustrated thing that explains how "the box of daily experience" is really sad
yes, things we do tend to fall into their own time of the day, and anything new or exciting added to it actually feels like just a little drop of exciting stuff, along with everything else, being the same

so like, the box of normal life usually doesn't change, even if you stuff some new 

it's very useful, to be honest. a cycle in which each week is not very different from the other weeks, you can add some droplets of fun into your week, and everything else is predictable

there's always something that we wish to add to our life. we can call it the object of desire
whether a new job, a new house, or something, the object of desire represents a change in what we do, and may have a big impact on what the normal day looks like

exiting the box of the normal day allows you to go to other places. it brings things that you haven't seen before. new and exciting things.

so, i guess it's a [[vacation]] then... vacations are a very lengthy topic on their own


but the concept of a normal day means that the day has provided not much stimulus? things that are unremarkable, common and uninteresting?


discontentment.
"the thing that weighs on your mind is the same as what drove you from home" 

perhaps, with a bit of gratitude and contentment, we can truly appreciate what a normal day is


every moment can be awesome in the flow of time with proper attention and care. oh my god so inspirational

or, just find some awesomeness yourself. read and process things that are important, and new!
