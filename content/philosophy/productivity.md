productivity, by definition, is the subjective perception of how "productive" you are
personally, i feel that being productive is very important to the sense of fulfillment and stuff

time management and productivity are related, and they are both very important

it makes sense to say that for creative work, one should spend at most 4 hours a day on what matters most to them
it really makes sense to emphasize the times at which you cannot do certain things
