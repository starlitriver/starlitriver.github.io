a reliabilist theory of justified belief can be stated as follows:
one has a justified belief that p if, and only if, the belief is the result of a reliable process

reliabilist justification is a result of a reliable process
justified belief comes from valid dependable reasons
knowledge cannot simply be a guess and a belief needs to come from evidence or reputable and related information for it to be consider justified

this is the most strict way of saying something is justified

advantages of reliabilism
- it utilises rational knowledge to determine what is and is not knowledge
- it requires reputable background to validate beliefs
- it is not subject to [[the gettier problem]] because it provides a stricter definition of justification

disadvantages of reliabilism
- it is practically impossible to judge whether something is reliably justified - how do you validate if something is reliable?
