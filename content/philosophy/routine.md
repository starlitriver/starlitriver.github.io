yes, daily routines are boring . spending your entire year at 5 locations is less than ideal

maybe new and exciting things that get incorporated into parts of daily routines sometimes get old as well

say, if a day has a finite amount of events, and most things happen every single day without fail.

i guess, that's one reason why routine is really stressful
