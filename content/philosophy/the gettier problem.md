the gettier problem is the weakness of the [[plato's theory of knowledge]]

let us say that you look at the clock and it says it is 10:00
so you say, oh, it is 10:00
and you are right, it really is 10:00
but the clock was broken
it is justified. it is true. you believe it.
but do you really *know* that it is 10:00?
