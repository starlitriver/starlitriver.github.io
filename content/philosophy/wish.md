wishes and desires - some thoughts

desire. hmm. what is its definition?

a desire is a wish or want.

wish - feel or express a strong want or hope for something that is not easily attainable
want - a desire for something

okay, looks like the definition hunt isn't going so well.
let's try to avoid all the synonyms and try to decipher a thing or two

here is my definition of these words

wish - for some reason, someone wants something to happen in the world
want - for some reason, someone wants something to happen in the world, usually to their own benefit
desire - a want, but with even worse connotations

that was interesting lol


so wishes could be innovative or primitive, on a spectrum. what's this called

here are a few attributes to think about
- primitive stuff, enlightenment
- instinct, wisdom


sigh. wishes and attributes of them. this reminds me of the time i had to think about tasks and attributes of them
might be fun, but thinking about attributes is really hard.


the four wishes...

health
love
freedom
purpose

so true, right?

the four wishes are imbued in everything we do

every wish is consisted of these four fundamental wishes
