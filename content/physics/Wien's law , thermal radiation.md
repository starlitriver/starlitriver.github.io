Every object above 0 K emits some thermal radiation.

A blackbody is an ideal object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation (regardless of frequency or angle of incidence). It is a perfect absorber - does not reflect any incident radiation. It is a perfect emitter - the radiation it emits depends only on its temperature.

Figure: Peak wavelength is the most emitted wavelength of a specific temperature. The peak wavelength is lower for higher temperatures.

If an object is hotter, it will have more radiation for all wavelengths.

Wien's law relates the temperature of an object to the wavelength of blackbody radiation.

Wien's constant - $b=2.898\cdot 10^{-3}$ m K
T is temperature in kelvin.
$\lambda_{max}$ is the peak wavelength

$\lambda_{max}\cdot T=b$
