## fundamental forces

All forces can be reduced to the four fundamental forces: strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravity.

The strong force is _repulsive_ at very short distances, and _attractive_ at slightly longer distances. As a residual effect of holding together _quarks_, the strong force acts on _nucleons_.

### strong force

- Acts on protons and neutrons (both are nucleons, made of quarks).
- Not noticeable at the human scale (its range is incredibly short).
- _Very_ noticeable at the subatomic scale (it's what holds the nucleus together).

### weak force

- Acts on protons and neutrons (involved in beta decay).
- Not noticeable at the human scale.
- Noticeable at the subatomic scale (responsible for certain types of radioactive decay).

### electromagnetic force

- Acts on protons (charged particles).
- Does _not_ act directly on neutrons (they are neutral). While neutrons have internal quark structure with charge, the _net_ charge is zero, so the electromagnetic force doesn't directly affect whole neutrons in the same way it affects protons.
- _Very_ noticeable at the human scale (light, electricity, magnetism).
- Noticeable at the subatomic scale (holds electrons in orbit around the nucleus).

The electromagnetic force is a fundamental force, and the electrostatic and magnetic forces are its components. It is the electrostatic component that attracts/repels electrical charges from each other, and is the component which is most relevant in the nucleus.

## nuclear decay

The binding energy is the amount of energy you would need to add to the nucleus to completely break it apart into its individual protons and neutrons. It's the energy that _holds the nucleus together_. A higher binding energy means a more stable nucleus.

A nucleus will be stable when the strong force counteracts the electrostatic force. This means the nucleons do not have enough energy to do nuclear reactions.

A stable nucleus requires the strong force to be slightly stronger than the electrostatic force. This means the nucleus is more attracted to itself than repelled by itself. This means a larger binding energy per nucleon.

A nucleus decays and becomes a different element or isotope if decaying would increase the overall binding energy.

The easier it is to decay, the more unstable.



A nucleus with 20 or less protons and have same number of protons and neutrons are usually stable.

A nucleus with ==20 or less protons and have same number of protons and neutrons== is usually stable.
```

A nucleus with 21 to 83 protons needs more neutrons than protons to be stable.

A nucleus with 21 to 83 protons needs ==more neutrons than protons== to be stable.
```

> As the number of protons in the nucleus increases, the repulsive electromagnetic force between them also increases significantly. To counteract this and maintain stability, a greater number of neutrons is needed. The neutrons contribute to the strong nuclear force (which is attractive) without adding to the electrostatic repulsion. Therefore a neutron-to-proton ratio greater than 1 is required for stability in this range.


A nucleus with more than 84 protons is inherently unstable.

A nucleus with ==more than 84 protons== is inherently unstable.
```

Things that can cause nucleus unstable:
- Too many protons per neutron - too much electrostatic force.
- Too many neutrons per proton - neutrons are in higher energy states, making nucleus unstable.
- Too large - more than 84 protons cause the nucleus to be _inherently unstable_.

### half-life

Let $N_0$ be the number of nuclei at time $t=0$ half-lives. After one half-life, the number of nuclei remaining (N) is $N_0\cdot \dfrac{1}{2}$. Therefore $N=N_0(\dfrac{1}{2})^t$.

## radioactive decay

Radiation is the transmission of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves or high-speed particles.


A gamma ray is a ray of high energy photons.


alpha decay - the process by which an unstable nucleus decays into a more stable nucleus by emitting an alpha particle

alpha particle - a particle composed of two protons and two neutrons (the nucleus of a standard helium atom)

beta minus decay - the process by which an unstable nucleus decays into a more stable nucleus by transforming a neutron into a proton and emitting an electron and an antineutrino

beta particle - an electron (beta minus decay) or a positron (beta plus decay)  
beta plus decay the process by which an unstable nucleus decays into a more stable nucleus by transforming a proton into a neutron and emitting a positron and a neutrino daughter nuclide the nucleus remaining after radioactive decay occurs

gamma decay - the process by which an excited nucleus decays into a more stable nucleus by emitting energy in the form of gamma rays

ionising power the ability of a given type of radiation to cause another atom to lose electrons and become an ion

nuclide a nucleus with a specific number of neutrons and protons parent nuclide the original nucleus before radioactive decay occurs

penetrating power an indicator of the extent to which a given type of radiation can penetrate matter before it loses its energy

## subatomic particle

A subatomic particle is something smaller than an atom.

Here are some of them.

## radiation

There are four types of radiation. Alpha, beta-minus, beta-plus, and gamma emission.

### alpha decay

Alpha decay: A parent nucleus $\mathrm{X}$ emits an alpha particle (a helium nucleus ${}_{2}^{4}\textrm{He}$), reducing its atomic number $\mathrm{Z}$ by 2 and its mass number $\mathrm{A}$ by 4, transforming it into a daughter nucleus $\mathrm{Y}$.

${}_{Z}^{A}\textrm{X} \rightarrow {}_{Z-2}^{A-4}\textrm{Y} + {}_{2}^{4}\textrm{He}$

### beta-minus decay

Beta-minus decay: A neutron in the parent nucleus transforms into a proton, emitting an electron (e⁻, a beta-minus particle) and an antineutrino (ν̅). The atomic number increases by 1, while the mass number remains the same, resulting in a daughter nucleus.

${}_{Z}^{A}\textrm{X} \rightarrow {}_{Z+1}^{A}\textrm{Y} + {}_{-1}^{0}\textrm{e} + {}_{0}^{0}\overline{\nu}$

### beta-plus decay

Beta-plus decay: A proton in the parent nucleus transforms into a neutron, emitting a positron (e⁺, a beta-plus particle, the antimatter counterpart of an electron) and a neutrino (ν). The atomic number decreases by 1, while the mass number remains the same, resulting in a daughter nucleus.

${}_{Z}^{A}\textrm{X} \rightarrow {}_{Z-1}^{A}\textrm{Y} + {}_{+1}^{0}\textrm{e} + {}_{0}^{0}\nu$

### gamma emission

Gamma emission: An excited parent nucleus $\mathrm{X}^{*}$ transitions to a lower energy state $\mathrm{X}$ by emitting a high-energy photon (also a gamma ray). Neither the atomic number nor the mass number changes.

${}_{Z}^{A}\textrm{X}^{*} \rightarrow {}_{Z}^{A}\textrm{X} + {}_{0}^{0}\gamma$
