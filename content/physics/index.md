Physics is the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion through either space and time or spacetime, and the related entities of energy and force.

Although physics is based on empirical evidence, all physics we learn are theoretical physics, a branch of physics that employs mathematical models and abstractions of physical objects to rationalize, explain and predict natural phenomena.
