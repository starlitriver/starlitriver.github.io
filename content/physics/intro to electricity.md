Electrons are negative and protons are positive.

Electric charge $Q$ is what causes forces when placed in electromagnetic field. The unit is coulomb, where one coulomb $C$ is 6.242e18 elementary charges.

Electric current $I$ is the rate at which charge flows in a circuit is the same throughout the entire circuit. The unit is ampere $A$, where one ampere is one coulomb per second.

Relationship between charge, current and time is $Q=It$

## DC and AC

Direct current and alternating current are different.

## voltage

Voltage is measured as joules per coulomb of charge given by the power supply.

## relationships

E is energy in joules
Q is charge in coulombs
V is electric potential in volts
I is current in amperes
t is time in seconds
P is power in watts
R is resistance in ohms


$E=QV=Pt$
$Q=It$
$P=VI=I^2R=\dfrac{V^2}{R}$
$V=IR$
