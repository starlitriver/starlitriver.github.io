**Newton's First Law: Law of Inertia**

An object in will remain at rest or in constant motion (non-accelerating) until a force is applied to it.  
	
An example of this is in space. If you are floating in space you will float in that direction forever unless a force is applied to you.

	

**Newton's Second Law: F = ma**

The Net Force (final force) a mass carries is dependent on its mass and acceleration.

	
​

**Newton's Third Law: Law of Action and Reaction**

For every action force there is an equal and opposite reaction force.
