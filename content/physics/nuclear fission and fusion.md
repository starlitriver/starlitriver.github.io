Mass and energy are essentially the same, as seen in the equation $E=mc^2$

This equation suggests that a big amount of energy can make a small amount of mass.

When energy is added to an object, its mass increases.

For objects like atoms, this increase in mass is more significant. For example, 


$1 \text{eV}=1.6\cdot 10^{-19}$. 1 electronvolt (1 eV) is the kinetic of energy an electron or proton would gain when going across a potential difference of 1 volt (1 V).
