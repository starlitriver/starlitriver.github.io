## absorbed dose

$D=\dfrac{E_r}{M}$

D is absorbed dose in Gy, Joules per kilogram

$E_r$ is energy absorbed in Joules

$M$ is mass in kilograms.

## equivalent dose

$H=D\cdot w_r$

Where $H$ is equivalent dose in Sv, Joules per kilogram.

$W_r$ is the quality factor, no units.

Figure: Weighting factor of radiation.

| radiation | $w_r$ |
| --------- | ----- |
| alpha     | 20    |
| beta      | 1.0   |
| gamma     | 1.0   |

## effective dose

Effective dose is a measure of the potential for long term and organ specific damage.

$E=\sum(H\cdot w_t)$

Where $E$ is effective dose in Sv, Joules per kilogram.

$H$ is equivalent dose in Gy, Joules per kilogram.

$w_t$ is tissue weighting factor, no units.

Figure: Weighting factor of tissue.

| tissue  | $w_t$ |
| ------- | ----- |
| brain   | 0.010 |
| liver   | 0.040 |
| lung    | 0.12  |
| stomach | 0.12  |
