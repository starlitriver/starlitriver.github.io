in Buddhism, the four noble truths are concepts that apply to life, and are the "truths and realities for the spiritually worthy ones"

the truths are:
- [[dukkha]] is an innate characteristic of life
- [[tanha]] arises simultaneously with dukkha
- [[nirodha]] is letting go of tanha which relieves dukkha
- the [[noble eightfold path]] is the way to achieve nirodha
