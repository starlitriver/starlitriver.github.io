`Sometimes I think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist,
The only reason we can’t win is the fates themselves have missed.
Yet, there lives on the ancient claim – we win or lose within ourselves,
The shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow’s game.
So you and I know deeper down there is a chance to win the crown,
But when we fail to give our best, we simply haven’t met the test
Of giving all and saving none until the game is really won.
Of showing what is meant by grit, of fighting on when others quit,
Of playing through not letting up, it’s bearing down that wins the cup.
Of taking it and taking more until we gain the winning score,
Of dreaming there’s a goal ahead, of hoping when our dreams are dead,
Of praying when our hopes have fled. Yet, losing, not afraid to fall,
If bravely we have given all, for who can ask more of a man
than giving all within his span, it seems to me, is not so far from – Victory.
And so the fates are seldom wrong, no matter how they twist and wind,
It’s you and I who make our fates, we open up or close the gates,
On the Road Ahead or the Road Behind.`,

It's a feeling almost indescribable - architect Christopher Alexander called it "the quality without a name."
And yet, though neither of us can name it, it's universally understood.
It's a feeling of intense rightness, a moment that is perfect without anything added or taken away.
It's a feeling of resonance, like the moment strikes a note you've been listening for all your life.
It's a feeling of calmness, of balance. That "all is well, and all will be well."
It is completing and soothing in its wholeness.
It's freedom with an absence of striving.
It is a moment that's not trying to be any other moment.
It feels timeless in the truth of it, like a gift that stands outside of trend or measurement.
Awe, wonder and possibility are all available to you.
You know - ALIVE`,

i'm not who i once was
but don't you know who you are
what's been done for you?`,
`you are more than the choices that you've made
you are more than the sum of your past mistakes
you are more than the problems you create
you've been remade`,

but what's been done for you
this is not about where you've been
but where your brokenness brings you to`,

i love the rolling hills
i love the flowers

`when you find yourself
in some far off place
and it causes you
to rethink some things

you start to sense that slowly you're becoming someone else
and then you find yourself

when you make new friends
in a brand new town
and you start to think
about settlin' down

when you go through life
so sure of where you're headin'
and you wind up lost
and it's the best thing that could've happened

'cause sometimes when you lose your way
it's really just as well
because you find yourself
yeah, that's when you find yourself`,
`i had a dream so big and loud
i jumped so high i touched the clouds
oh
i'm never gonan look back
i'm never gonna give it up
please don't wake me now`,
`i wake up kinda wired
and i wake up kinda cold
and i wake up kinda tired
but i'll just sleep in when i'm old
see i don't like breaking rules
but don't like doing as i'm told
so i just float around and keep my head down
and hope my life unfolds

and еverybody's telling me that i'm doing so wеll
i try to trust them, honestly i find it hard to tell
if i need work or i need rest, i try my best to try my best
i tell myself, i say out loud, it's fine i'll figure it all out

i tend to forget
i'm still only quite young
in a way this life of mine has only just begun

i've got time
i've got time

the one thing that's important above everything else
is to learn not to put all this heavy pressure on myself
i try believe it when i say
if it's meant to happen it'll happen anyway
i'll be fine

i've got time
i've got time`,
`look up when the world gets you down

you got me floating on cloud nine`,

sometimes i believe, at times i'm rational
i can fly high, i can go low
today i got a million. tomorrow, i don't know`,

i could show you what you wanna see
and take you where you wanna be`,

always knew where i was gonna go next
didn't know until i saw your face
i was missing out on every moment
you'll be one and, baby, i'll be two

so if it's real
then darling let me know
i wouldn't mind
if you steal the show`,

i know your arms are reaching out from
somewhere beyond the clouds`,

come ride with me to the distant shore

we won't hesitate to break down the garden gate

life is a highway
i wanna ride it all night long
if you're going my way
i wanna drive it all night long`,
`step out, step out of the sun
if you keep getting burned
step out, step out of the sun
because you've learned, because you've learned

on the outside always looking in
will i ever be more than i've always been?
cause i'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
i'm waving through a window

i try to speak but nobody can hear
so, i wait around for an answer to appear
while i'm watch, watch, watching people pass
i'm waving through a window, oh-oh-oh-oh
can anybody see? is anybody waving back at me?`,
`here's to the ones that we got
cheers to the wish you were here but you're not

of everything we've been through

toast to the ones that we lost on the way

and the memories bring back memories bring back you`,
`she wants to be a painter
but she only ever paints when she's alone
by the fire in the back room of her home
she finds so much beauty in the colours
but she's afraid
that it won't be found by others

hour after hour in that same chair
drawing shapes no one will ever see
and as she paints she hums a melody`,
`you can't fade away
the way i feel for you
there ain't no word i can say
what i do for you
and every single day
i make it through this game called life
it's always filled with pain and strife
reality will cut you like a knife
it ain't right

but with you by my side
we will win this fight
in the battle of dark and light
take my hand, hold it tight
when we dance, i feel alright
by your side is where i'll be
endless love won't fade you'll see
when i walk you'll walk with me
together let the light shine`,
`i messed up tonight
i lost another fight
i still mess up but i'll just start again
i keep falling down
i keep on hitting the ground
but i always stand up now to see what's next

i won't give up, no, i won't give in
till I reach the end, and then i'll start again
no, i won't leave, i wanna try everything
i wanna try even though i could fail`,

hang in when the world counts you out
and you're gonna be fine
sometimes
that's life
some days nothing ever goes right
but when your hand is in mine
you got me floating on cloud nine`,
`'cause your heart has a lack of color
and we should've known
that we'd grow up sooner or later
'cause we wasted all our free time alone`,
`i'm tired of waking up in tears
cause i can't put to bed these phobias and fears
i'm new to this grief i can't explain
but i'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain
the fire i began is burning me alive
but i know better than to leave and let it die`,
`i'm a silhouette
asking every now and then
is it over yet?
will i ever feel again?
i'm a silhouette
chasing rainbows on my own
but the more i try to move on
the more i feel alone
so i watch the summer stars to lead me home`,
`i'm sick of the past i can't erase
a jumble of footprints and hasty steps i can't retrace
the mountain of things i still regret
is a vile reminder that i would rather just forget
(no matter where i go)
the fire i began is burning me alive
but i know better than to leave and let it die`,
`the silence isn't so bad
till i look at my hands and feel sad
cause the spaces between my fingers
are right where yours fit perfectly`,

do you believe in the impossible?

the pleasure will be ours
and with young unbroken hearts
we'll walk among the stars`,
`it's time to begin
isn't it
i get a little bit
bigger but then
i'll admit
i'm just the same as i was
oh don't you understand?
i'm never changing who i am`,
`there were days when each hour was a war i fought to survive
there were nights full of nightmares and i dreaded closing my eyes
there were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive
but the world took a spark like a match in the dark
and the fire brought me to life
so i'm fanning the flames to climb so high
'cause there's no other way we can stay alive`,
`'cause we're burning bright
as we all unite
and when it's all said and done
we'll shine like the sun
so don't let the fire die
and we'll watch the sky
as it fills with light
and though the embers are new
whatever you do, just don't let the fire die`,
`i see your true colors
shining through
i see your true colors
that's why i love you

so don't be afraid
to let them show
you true colors
true colors
are beautiful`,
`tell me again, was it love at first sight
when i walked by and you caught my eye?
didn't you know love could shine this bright?
well, smile because you're a deer in the headlights`,
`yeah we made it through the dark
harmony is everywhere
put your hair up in the air!`,
`through the glass in my bedroom window
in the bushes far below
i thought i saw an unfamiliar shadow
among the ones i so clearly know
i've been sleeping with the nightlight unplugged
with a note on the rocking chair
i've been dreaming about the life i once loved
so wake me if you're out there`,
`i got my head out the sunroof
i'm blasting our favorite tunes
i only got one thing on my mind
you got me stuck on the thought of you
you're making me feel brand new
you're more than the sunshine in my eyes`,
`people all over the world
join hands
start a love train, love train`,
`cause i don't have a clue what to get you
so i'll give you my heart
i hope it'll do`,
`in dinosaur park
long after dark
i wonder what happens there
when no one's around
does some kind of magic fill the air?

i won't ever prove that statues can move
but i'd like to think they do
so i make believe with all of my heart
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
there's magic afoot, unseen in the dark
in dinosaur park`,
`you've gotta know that you tear me up
when you say
you wanna take it all away, take it all away
you tear me up
when you say
you wanna take it all away, take it all away
you were the one, and it was enough
to be the one you were dreaming of
you were the one and we called it love
and now you take it all away, take it all away`,
`so, don't you go, no, don't you go
'cause don't you know i'm up here alone
so high, like a satellite
i'm sending you a signal tonight
oh, oh, oh like a streak of light
oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by
oh, oh, oh rev your engine up
everybody's racing at the speed of love`,
`so i look up at the stars to guide me
and throw caution to every warning sign
i'm sure there will be challenges that find me
but i can take them on one at a time
so i make this wish
to have something more for us than this`,
`it feels like i'm a lone survivor
forgotten in a dark and deadly world
and on my own
i walk alone
to see the sun again, i'd give anything
but life demands a final chapter
a story that we all must leave behind
it's do or die
and this is mine
the anthem of a bird
with a broken wing`,
`it's another bad dream
poison in my blood stream
i'm dying but I can't scream
will you show me the way?

it's another wolf bite
howlin' in the moonlight
i wanna get my life right!
will you show me the way?`,
`you rescued me
and i believe
that god is love and he is all i need
from this day forth to all eternity

i'll never wander on my own
for i am yours until you call me home
i close my eyes and i can hear you say
you're not alone`,
`her heart is built to take it
my heart is complicated
she thinks love is an easy thing to find

my heart has seen it all and
her heart is beautiful and blind`,
`flowing through the seas of time
memories that were left behind
bring us closer to the end of this journey
where we grew as friends
take me through the mist and stumps
and waters that are still unknown
under guiding starlit sky
we will learn how to say goodbye

and i'll take your hand and guide you through
all the steps one takes to move on to
a place, a world unseen to us all
but it's okay, we'll be together

and i'll take your hand and guide you through
all the steps one takes to move on to
a place, a world unseen to us all
but i know we will remember

and i'll take your hand and guide you through
all the steps one takes to move on to
a place, a world unseen to us all
but it's okay, we'll be together, my friend`,
`i'll be there for the highs and lows
give you mine if your heart gets broke
by your side when you're all alone
i will be there
for you`,
`i was 22
alone with nothing to do
and I couldn't sleep
'cause all those cold days
returned with their old ways
of causing new apathy
i live alone, i live alone`,
`never mind i'll find
someone like you
i wish nothing but the best
for you, too
don't forget me
i beg, i'll remember you say
sometimes it lasts in love
but sometimes it hurts instead`,
`and clearly i don't see myself upon that list
but she said
where'd you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
i'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
some superhero
some fairytale bliss
just someone i can turn to
somebody i can kiss
i want something just like this`,
`this fight of my life is so hard
so hard, so hard
but i'm gonna survive
oh oh, these are beautiful times!`,
`cause lovers dance when they're feeling in love
spotlight shining, it's all about us
it's all, all, all
about us
and every heart in the room will melt
this is a feeling i've never felt, but
it's all about us`,
`run away with me
we're on the way to new york city
take my hand and see
manhattan never looked so pretty
travel light and see the world right
you'll never know if you never go, so
run away with me
and say hello to new york city`,
`just let me take you to a better place
gonna make you kiss the sky tonight
and if you let me show the way
i'm so excited to see you excited`,
